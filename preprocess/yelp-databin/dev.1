_num_ .
the tiramisu and cannoli 's are perfect .
a good , safe bet for chinese food .
i would give zero stars if possible .
ordered the brothers special sicilian .

the rest are worthless , unreliable , and extremely rude and unprofessional !
when telling cashier , he acted like he did n't hear me .

fantastic customer service and smiles .
it 's just too weird .
they did , and the pastries were delicious .
a month apart and now i am concerned about having another experience .
food was warm that was suppose to be cold and chicken wings were old .
_num_ star there .
this was a memorable and challenging course .
service - sketchy ... um appetizers are served before the entree not after .
the best wings in phoenix .
the costumer service was excellent and the food was pretty good and good price !
this was pretty neat to me .
wings and beer compliment the experience .
i love the staff here as well .
it too was similar .
i feel like sleeping on a park bench would have satisfied me more !
she just is n't thorough .
parking is horrible !
however , i 'm not paying for any of those things .
it 's delicious !
to start , the place is beautiful .
do not use this company !
the deli and prepared food area smells bad .
they have some good carne asada and amazing rolled tacos .
spent _num_ minutes passed that to finally be attended too .
awesome sandwich , with great bread .
i had _num_ minutes to make it to the new location before they closed .
beautiful place to go horseback riding .
i guess that is not the case .
still no server at this point .
delivery was fast and food was great .
bottom line , exceptional customer service !
they get my order wrong .
my husband and i love this place and have been coming for years .

this store has a great staff !
it 's the perfect place for a weekend breakfast .
ate there with co-worker and we had fresh fries and everything was delicious !
everything i have had on their menu is delicious .
i went there today and had really great service !
avoid this location at all cost !
i was very disappointed .
do not get sucked into the hype of that dumb commercial .
wtf i took the room and headed to 3rd floor hell .
thanks for sharing the graduation event and thanks for the hospitality .
bad service .
authentic , ambient , clean , quick , friendly , and delicious !
i would definitely go back and would recommend everyone to try it !
the whole drink area was a mess as was the dining area .
very reasonable prices and all the food has great flavor .
they are always perfect !
if i could rate a zero i would .
the service was also very friendly .
spent money on crappy food and horrible service !
what a treat the `` happy family '' entree is !
she was amazing !
i 'm not surprised this subway only has _num_ star !
not a regular roach a huge sewer roach .
she was amazing !
completely flavorless in my opinion .
i do n't know how else to put it .
first time here and the service was very good .
great food and the service is one of the best .
their bread is amazing , though .
but didnt think it meant getting a _num_ % cooked pizza .
cashier was very friendly and always willing to help .
we received the best service ever at a fair price .
but why would i , i did n't suspect them .
the menu is short and everything will be good .
the fried rice was great .
making me sick just thinking about it .
good food .
the inside was clean and well lit .
ahh , this place is refreshing .
great bunch of people !
i wo n't be ordering pizza from here again .

bomb wings but slow service .
eat here occasionally , good food choices for everyone .
the wait was reasonable , especially for brunch on a sunday .
_num_ .
the horses were great .
i love it !
but lack of integrity , i am looking somewhere else this evening .
but this one really had a good feeling .

i saw them put _num_ small containers front of me and said no .
the pizza was really good as well .
this guy was happy to do his job and do it well .
service was prompt , courteous , and fast .
they do n't have my ink .

our server cody was awsome and very friendly .
fresh donuts , clean and fast .
so much food , we had to take it home .
never had eggs cooked so perfectly before .
its great service and great steaks .
i highly recommend this place and will absolutely be back .
the food looked old , the lettuce wilted , it just looked gross .
the non-smoking room reeked , but that was n't even the start .
very knowledgeable and straight to the point .
great job arizona humane society , you make arizona a better place .
yelp failed us on this one .
we 've tried all their main entres & they are all delightful .
the gentleman behind the counter was very friendly and helpful .
very good food , and inexpensive too .
their food was delicious .
she did n't greet me politely or acknowledge that i was there .
the room is simple with a small electric stove , sink , and microwave .
while the pizza was decent , the wings were awesome .
but i am not sure about the frozen lunch meat you are offered .
keep up the good work .
anyhow , i think there are probably better places to eat in the area .
the place looks gross , old and not clean at all .
i have been here _num_ times .
all i can say is wow .
like money was brought up a lot .
Neutral
my kids absolutely love the video games and ice cream cones .
denise did n't remember ever speaking with me .
i would recommend this to anyone !
who does n't want to savor every minute of their lunch hour ?
the staff here is always very friendly and very very helpful !
service was a bit slow and not that friendly .
she knows what i like and always recommends it !
awesome authentic bosnian food in a totally unexpected location .
happy eats !
everyone was so friendly to me and i felt well informed .
very good food !
i love the people they are always so nice !
the food was amazing and the culture was better .
they have a good selection and prices are decent .
the customer service is horrible .
will come back next time we come into town .
meaning mexican style fajita cooking .
i called the salon before purchasing the groupon to check their availability .
the exam was decent , but after that it went downhill !
do n't go here if you want any kind of service .
the same day service is convenient .
poor customer service , poor quality pizza .
i assure you , i have no problem paying my way .
will definitely come back with the whole family .
it 's right next to qt .
this place has authentic mexican food , the chicken tacos are great !
well worth a trip for a taste of italy .
all in all , a very good lunch .
recently moved to the area .
always has a far price .
we will definitely go back .
buying here was the mistake of the year .
this was awful pizza .
they toasted my bread and popped the corned beef in the microwave .
nevertheless , i love coming to this market !
love love love it .
filthy restrooms with no paper towels .
my poor pup , with no teeth at only _num_ yrs old .
goods move fast so there is always something new to find .
the selection was similar to sweet tomatoes , but lower quality .
the food is lacking quality and cost is not that great .
he makes it right everytime we ask for him !
the staff is really nice and the food was excellent .
nothing was ever mentioned about smoking rooms .
great customer service .
had to stop for breakfast and used the drive through .
serves bad and slow .
pretty sad , really .
this place pretty much sucked .
this is a step above what i was expecting .
very rude girls working here !
every now and then they have pretty good soup too !
the staff are very friendly and helpful .
i would keep going to this place for that great service !
this place is horrible !
the movie detail sucks .
i walked in and they told me they 're closed .
at the end you 'll be surprised & satisfied with the pricing .
so the salad was a fail .
needless to say i tried every milk they had and enjoyed all of them .
was it a bit too fat ? ''
there was no one else in there .
a nice clean restaurant .
he was very nice and apologized for my experience .
_num_ .
will definitely be back next time in phoenix .
goodbye macayo 's , you will be missed .
the staff are very friendly and happy to explain the different dishes .
how else can one explain the _num_ and _num_ stars for this place ?
worth checking out if you are on that side of town .
food was `` meh '' , maybe i just ordered the wrong thing .
not much of the egg was noticeable in either dish .
this one in particular is always nice to go into .
wonderful bosnian food .
skip skip skip it .
zero stars just the middle finger .
i just spent _num_ days throwing up , diarrhea .
great customer service !
this is real mexican style food .
authentic bosnian food according to my bosnian friends .
the elevator button was missing for a bit on the third floor .
i 'm pretty sure you 'll walk out of there sick !
needless to say , i would n't recommend this company to anyone ever !
this restaurant was very disappointing .
i devoured the food .
i now take my own family here .
this was my first visit here and i was impressed .
this one is trashy !
the enchiladas were the real disappointment .
this is the best drunk food drunk money can buy .
it fell short of the layered , fried chicken crust this dish should have .
place is amazing !
_num_ .
true italian food ... no one i 've been there with has been disappointed .
keep it up !
not the best mexican resturant we 've been to , but it 's cheap !
i asked for _num_ queen beds and got _num_ double beds .
according to aaa , the wrong size filter was installed .
drove away , got on freeway headed out of town .
im pissed !
i always love this place .
not very tasty , not authentic sopapillas .
both times the bartender was too busy to take my dinner order .
come on over i guarantee you will be born again .
i will definitely recommend it to others , and be back myself !
and their steaks are tasty .
good service and fast .
online pick up you better be ready for long delays .
my new favorite restaurant !
any other store , one could request a price check .
the food was awful .
i clearly ordered the special when i walked in .
round tables make seating a large group a bit strange but love the place .
the assistant manager jose is great as well .
the dish was very bland .
very good food .
tasty coffee , love their pancakes .
do not stop here if you are wanting fast service .
great food !
definately a place you can bring the family or just go for happy hour !
we did n't have to wait very long before our meal was delivered .
that is to say , service was totally non-existent .
the only thing worse than the room was the staff .
our server was great !
!
i wish i would have gone with them !
delicious carne asada !
the staff is courteous and friendly and the morning coffee is good .
trying to get in and out is a constant challenge .
i need to cancel my membership and ask for my money back .
i 'm just disappointed .
they also have great customer service .
i 'm very happy !
frankly , i know better than to order wings from a national chain store .
this was my last visit to any outback .
fast friendly service and fresh food .
rude management , tasteless food , overpriced .
this is the worst place ever .
my boyfriend got the enchilada sampler which was amazing !
so for _num_ , i would skip this place !
waffles were looking good .
it melted in my mouth .
food was quick and delicious .
staff is always smiling and very courteous !
i have to say it 's the worst smelling la fitness in the valley .
will be coming back for sure !
the customer service and the food has always stayed consistent .
i will not be coming back to this one .
very rudely he asked if he should do my fix before everyone else 's .
great food .
they keep excellent medical records on each animal that comes through their system .
myself and my family will not be returning to the place .
always great food , service , and prices !
first off , their lay out is all over the place .
no wonder the place was empty .
however always check your order !
right now , _num_ '' cold cut or meatball subs are _num_ .
i washed my hands and there were no paper towels .
they do n't live up to their name .
i liked the food and service .
kid friendly as well .
apparently , i was not the only one with the roach issue .
i would suggest they hire someone with more experience working with customers .
but no one told me !
i wo n't be staying here ever again .
this place sucks !
phoenix az ... .
it was weird .
went through drive thru , ordered two _num_ piece chicken strips .
if i could give this place no stars , i would .
the waitress ( mothers granddaughter ) is sweet and gives solid service .
it was very busy .
do n't fall for this .
he got everything but the lower bun .
love this place for breakfast .
when seated the table was not clean .
price is right .
very rude staff .
the sides were terrible .
no drink order .
if you like these fake chinese buffets , then ignore this review .
possibly the best tortas in the west valley .
and love him and his staff .
so done trying new nail places .
very good , highly recommend to friends and family .
the point of having a _num_ hour location is for convenience .
normally a person will tip _num_ % - _num_ % of their bill .
they really need to get some workers in there that know how to cook .
granted it was busy .
not to mention , they messed up on my dad 's order .
for a moment i thought i 'm eating mom food .
i love this place .
the deli is great , good fresh bread & meat .
the breakfast burritos are worth coming back for .
this place was by far the worst .
they were out of mushrooms , so i expected more veggies on it .
enjoyed the food !
hey we have been getting complaints that our pizza sucks .
waited _num_ minutes at the service desk .
good portions super cheap and food is pretty good !
my baby is crying , im hungry , an this is just dumb ... .
and the cashier was a complete bitch .
one time i came in on a friday and only one teller was working .
service was alright but the food was terrible .
best deal in the whole valley .
_num_ .
all of them are great also the chorizo and carne .
the mac n cheese was almost gone .
horrible .
this place is terrible !
no `` here you go ! ''
i ca n't believe that i just paid $ _num_ for her groom .
tip to all the panda express managers .
there was nothing special .
she then did not follow the comment up with a reason !
i did n't have tub , just a shower with a seat .
all in all ... we will not be coming back .
so he proceeded to hand me my order and then asked for the money .
this place is awesome .
no one should have to wait _num_ 1/2 hours to complete a vet exam .
i would highly recommend him !
completely inappropriate !
not a fan .
great family owned restaurant .
to make matters worse , the place has all the atmosphere of a warehouse .
great subs lots of food .
gross .
none of the six of them acknowledged me .
love their pizza and wing special .
good place to come for lunch if you work in the area .
if you ask after they give you your bag they get all mad .
i was told the wait time would be _num_ minutes .
the orange chicken is a must .
really good food for the price .
she said , sorry you 're next .
fantastic service , very clean and fresh and delicious .
phenomenal !
would n't accept my coupon from verizon .
please do step inside .
no napkins in main lobby .
great food and very friendly service .
thanks , francisco .
maybe i am just visiting at the wrong time .
and the coffee there is good too .
i want my old lenny 's back .
if your in the neighborhood , definitely worth the stop .
and the salad looked old .
this does n't even come close .
it tastes bland .
great little place .
i love the colorful personality 's of the staff .
serve it with a limp iceberg and a bland dressing , that 's how .
harold came as a recommendation from my regular mechanic .
guess it 's not my thing .
i am not exaggerating .
i love the crust and their wings are great too !
honestly , i would only leave zero stars if i could .
service and food was amazing .
they have great lunch specials worth every last penny .
when you pay for your order her proceeds to walk away after your change .
maybe that 's why the inside of the restaurant was so dead .
food is always delicious .
i brought my friends to try something different and we left happy .
total , almost $ _num_ !
love the food here .
great salad bar and good food !
also the golf carts were very loud .
will never , ever visit this establishment again !
i had to spend the day cleaning and getting rid of bed bugs !
chicken was hot and yummy .
i will be getting a full refund !
my dough was mushy , crust was soft and had no crisp to it .
worse service ever .
oops , i was using caps !
the staff is rude , unpleasant and just a bad experience .
their cookies are tasty too .
surprisingly we did n't wait too long until our party of _num_ was seated .
Neutral
what an awesome experience !
her potato was burnt and dry .
called early this morning at 8am to schedule an appointment for an oil change .
not to mention the place was filthy !
plain and simple .
best in the business .
and mighty fine waffle house food .
his work is great and he does it for so little .
my kids love coming here .
i was there just as long as if i had ordered in the store .
the donuts are n't greasy and they have a really good flavor .
making my wings get cold as i waited for the pizza to get done .
i have always found the staff very helpful .
the steak had absolutely no taste .
went for an hour , will definitely come back for more fun !
this is a great company to work with .
this gym is always dirty , and equipment is either broken or outdated .
she returned a couple mins later with sad fixes , but sorta fixes .
the lady that runs this place is awesome - extremely friendly .
did n't even acknowledge us .
first time customer with my dad today .

no , just the regular oil change , thanks .
delicious food , generous portions and good price .
this place knows how to cook and has great customer service .
otherwise great food !
they do an awesome job at an affordable price .
there are only like _num_ chairs inside .
order was wrong .
very disappointed in the quality of the food .
i did n't really care where i was going to stay .
like they do n't give a crap .
that was definitely a nice touch .
keep an eye on the prices .
she handed me the mirror and said `` what do you think ? ''
i was so stoked to find a place near me , with good reviews .
big mistake .
called in a delivery order from this location and it was late .
the food is cheap and delicious and the interior decor is gorgeous .
i have never had such terrible service , especially from management as well .
no words for this experience .
good price .
thanks for you great service tony !
not so good .
the food came quick and was really good .
i would totally recommend this location and i will be returning !
amazing prices too !
went upstairs to bring the mattress down .
Negative
i could go on and on but i am sure you get the point .
not really fried rice , just seasoned rice .
i 'm never going there again .
horrible !
thank you !
bad !
our _num_ month old had bed bugs on her .
said she 'd be back with it , never returned with one .
will definitely come back .
when is the last time you were here '' blah blah blah .
there are three left and i believe this is the worst of them .
poor customer service .
i went in as a guest no fee charged .
wrong !
my car got to its destination extremely fast and the service was wonderful .
i spoke with a manager , erica martin about our happy hour drinks .
i did n't like his service at all .
wish i could give them zero stars .
i never expect much from taco bell ... but wow these guys are awesome !
regardless of which location we go to we get the same excellent service !
yes it 's located in the `` ghetto '' , but it 's delicious .
friendly staff .
my boyfriend got orange chicken and teriyaki chicken so we could share everything .
ok , all done with red lobster for a good long while now .
the customer service is usually awful and the cashier lines are rarely ever open .
best place to get ice-cream .
i would recommend this place to anybody who loves pizza .
we waited _num_ minutes while multiple workers walked by before someone would help us .
great reliable company .
my husband thought the carne asada was tender and flavorful .
great place to eat in a pinch .
i 'm impressed with how fast they can make the food .
this is a go to place for a great hand tossed ny style pizza .
i 'm disappointed to say i 'll be avoiding this one for now on .
its so much better than the other chinese food places in the west valley .
tammy was a great trip guide .
all i could taste was extremely burnt onions and insanely soggy bun .
everyone we met there was very kind and quite funny .
plus gum on the arm of the chair ( gross ) oh and chips .
i love cherry and vanilla flavors and always add one to my drink .
that is ridiculous !
i ca n't see what other people see in this place .
i 'm so glad to have such an amazing thrift store in my neighborhood .
the staff went above and beyond and were actually pleasant .
very nice man .
the owner was great !
another _num_ minutes go by i called back she then told me _num_ minutes .
if i could give it zero stars , i would .
i did n't believe them like i stated above .
i took my sierra pickup to these guys and they did a fantastic job .
great food , friendly staff ... must try !
service - top notch .
she brought me my drink , minus the straw .
there was hardly any ice cream at all in mine .
i guess i need to spell that out more clearly next time .
they have a lunch special and larger specials that can feed a family .
the staff is always friendly .
i do n't care if it 's only $ _num_ .
it would have been fine or i would have went else where .
the amount of business alone should make it worth your while .
i love the atmosphere !
the staff works hard to make sure they do a great job .
this place is for the cheap and dirty sort .
the other constant is how rude everyone is .
why why why ?
i 'm usually a big fan of olive garden .
i air dried from my shower instead .
of my entree , only the salad was great !
worst hotel experience ever .
as a server that really makes a difference !
worst hotel i 've stayed in ever .
no problem with the actual care at the facility .
mattress is _num_ months old .
my husband purchased some of their house made hot sausage .
great authentic bosnian food !
lots of shady people out and about .
i have been there twice and the food was plentiful and oh so fresh .
by far one of the best places to get a torta in arizona .
i do not steal , do n't have to and never have .
i will never set foot inside another macayo 's again .
got off the phone another _num_ min later the driver got to our house .
i will never be back to metro barber shop and not give anymore referrals .

brings me back to my childhood growing up in new jersey !
steak and ribs outstanding .
he was extremely knowledgeable and patient with me .
i always order it when i go there and it is always awesome .
it 's the best i 've had and it 's relatively cheap !
this location on the other hand is dirty , unfriendly , and unprofessional .
i had the best customer service from francisco tonight !
this place does n't deserve any stars their customer service is horrible !
great first delivery !
i recently went in to a wal-mart establishment in phoenix az store # _num_ .

this doctor was horrible .
this is a great place to find a new friend .

he went to prepare our food without washing his hands .
i recommend them to anyone .
overall , would not return .
happy family is a mother great dish .
please do n't stay here .
great atmosphere and team .
and this restaurant hits all those dishes with top marks .
the store is clean & organized very well .
unfortunately for the price of rent here the apartments are really dated .
i would n't go here for a meal ever again .

would definitely recommend it for a quick local flavorful bite to eat .
the food is always hot and fresh .
made an appointment to get my oil changed at 8am on june 2nd .
the management sucks .
needless to say we were shocked .

the food was amazing .
i love the warm syrup and everything is cooked fresh .
it was pretty awful .
the orange chicken was not good .
the food is very good and the service is very nice .

the only good thing about this place is that its cheap .
if i could give negative rating omg i would .
i sat down and waited .

when she took the acrylics off she left my nails completely broken .
this time i brought the family here .
she was attentive , prompt and friendly .
highly recommend him !
really really good .
the food is always fresh and well prepared .
fed up i called the district manager .
which is less than we paid for by the way .
both waiters where rude and condescending .
staff is friendly and we 've never had a service problem .
i am not sure what the big deal is about this place .
it is still one of the best chinese restaurants in the valley .
great job !
the produce are fresh and the shelves are always full .
then an hour goes by no food .
unorganized and lack of integrity .
the staff is friendly and helpful and the deals are great .
so i was a little disappointed at this point .
the restroom had no toilet paper or hand soap .
not like they 're doing the work for free !
great service , speedy , and the food is very delicious .
well , no kidding !
_num_ for mani gel they did n't charge me for removal .
love their seafood soup .
for a first-time riding experience , this was great .
horrible !
i ordered the cheese ravioli with tomato sauce .
i would give this place a negative score if possible .
this place is fantastic .
the cashier was very friendly .
the crab puffs were also nice and big .
do not trust the minute clinic website !
lady was really rude .
best service i have ever gotten at this olive garden .
that 's too bad .
some of my favorite bars have been considered dive bars .
with the first bite i knew it was not what i expected .
sure enough , another _num_ minutes go by .
they also have wise potato chips and italian ice .
this location deserves zero stars !
merchandise is really outdated .
the guys gave good diagnostic to my car !
everyone in the salon is amazing !
everyone loved it !
i 've had nothing but bad experiences with then .
any chain restaurant , for that matter , has better pizza .
_num_ .
i did n't want to drink out of my glass .
i have nothing nice to say .
ca n't say i 've ever liked a dentist until now .
always a great place to run in and get the few items i need .
do not trust these people , and also rude .
i literally could n't believe what had happened .
i could go on and on about the great experience we had with francisco .
but i should have gone to a real salon .
i just had the best lunch ... as always the food is consistently great !
moved to goodyear from phoenix .
great food , great people and awesome service .
a little more professionalism and significantly more customer appreciation is needed at this company .
real food , great value .
it is all about up sale and scare tactics at this vet .
needs a new transmission , they say `` as is '' i get it .
very kind and courteous staff and it is very clean .
this is the best food i have had since arriving in phoenix .
they make me feel uncomfortable to shop for wigs .
it 's not gourmet but it 's great eats at unbeatable prices .
even my brother did n't want to finish them .
will not be coming back .
sauce tastes old and left over .
they have great service .
i requested a tow to coach works on a tuesday after hours .
well i remember how it tasted .
our waitress seemed rushed and never even came back to refill waters .
they have _num_ kinds of salsas and i really enjoyed the green one best .
home depot is usually pretty good .
honestly this is one of the worst food dining experiences i have ever had .
she ended up with a mild first degree burn on her stomach .
the food is awesome !
that is so great i think .
thank you for making us feel welcome , tina !
overall , it 's a typical chinese american restaurant .
why are they taking over all the airports , stations , and rest stops ?
i always come for my pedicures to amy .
i absolutely love love love their popcorn !
_num_ .
we loved them .
if your looking for authentic chinese food , this is the place !
i do n't understand why they do n't do dressing either .
thank you smile fitness , and to you dr. gordon for your response .
it is tolerable maybe once but not four times .
$ _num_ wi-fi charge .
absolutely the right place when you want to have a dinner with your family .
do n't go back to baskin and robbins !
love it !
and the service is also great every time i come here .
the place did n't even do anything for the birthday girl .
_num_ minutes to get _num_ cheese burgers and a small fry .
they ca n't find my house .
wow , what wonderful food !
the price of the sandwiches are very reasonable .
burns in the blankets and little dead bugs on top of bed !
comes with all you can eat pancakes .
i was so very disappointed .
go back and have bad service again and spend more $ ?
the staff is always friendly and professional .
what an awesome job !
we were so disappointed the chicken fried sirloin is so terrible .
positive : fast , friendly and fresh .
this place when using their coupon is an amazing value .
they treat you like family .
idiots !
looks scary from the outside , but it is good !
$ _num_ plus tax for two people , one bowl each !
i 'm pissed because good customer service would have been .
salad , zucchini , the ranch dressing , its all amazing .
the food and service were outstanding !
no apologies , nothing .
good service !
the animals seemed very happy and well taken care of .
too bad .
the next room was not under construction but clearly needed repairs .
i used to love olive garden but its become so blah .
actually , this location ( campus for compassion ) is truly magnificent .
the customer service is horrible !
best pork fried rice ever .
by the time our food got to the table , our drinks were empty .
i should not have gone .
here , this dish is bland , tasteless and has little to no seasonings .
even when they about and should be trying to get rid of their food .
stick to the wings and you 'll be okay .
but it was n't all that good either .
it was a thick burger smothered with salty onions , mushrooms & cheese .
thank you mcdonald 's for actually doing the jobs you were hired to do !
highly recommended !
this particular petsmart is no exception .
best wings in arizona .
best egg drop i have ever had .
tasted like they put tons of salt on it .
how absurd !
very pleasant service .
disappointing .
_num_ hours later it was ready .
this place is awsome !
it took maybe _num_ minutes .
she rings me up and hands me one cup .
the dressing was thin and tasteless , very little blue cheese flavor .
we will definitely be back !
just got a dog from the campus for compassion , what an incredible facility .
everyone there is nice .
but i love their food , especially their thai noodles .
it is a perfect place to get the short game on track .
i paid the $ _num_ and have never been back .
it was just a very unpleasant meal .
the door would not open .
we truly enjoy this church because it makes us feel part of the community .
they give you a short wait time , but did n't deliver .
their delivery service is always on time , pleasant , and focused .
we picked _num_ cities to stop in while driving .
wow is all i can use to describe the evening here .
there where _num_ waiters , still service was slow .
the desserts were delicious as well .
the staff was all very friendly and helpful .
the gentleman working there was very polite and helpful !
we gave up on getting him off our backs and walked out without ordering .
i leave not even a block away everything comes back on once again .
and we did n't even get chocolates with the check !
i visited macayo 's with a friend last night before a concert .
everything they put inside the sandwich just goes together so well .
i receive great customer service .
i love this place !
will be back when in town .
the customer service there was awful .
our tour guide cowboy was really nice and knew a ton about everything .
_num_ .
great guy and great service .
these guys are great !
they charged for unnecessary supplies for a very poor quality service .
huge portion !
i strongly suggest something ( anything ) else .
this last trip may have been the breaking point .
the food was disgusting .
( point here : texas roadhouse does n't have them ) .
it was corned beef on a roll .
no one is behind me not no line .
terrible customer service couldnt even tell me how much was on a gift card .
we are both very adventurous with food and love trying new things .
the staff were so kind , helpful and encouraging .
i could n't even bring myself to finish one bowl .
price is very reasonable , you get a lot of food .
so in conclusion , this store ... do n't , just ... do n't .
if anything , she seemed annoyed that she had to correct the order .
maybe mongolian grills are not my thing .
hands down one of the best places around .
some basic math and people skills would make the customer experience a lot better !
cool .
room was very adequate , quiet , and clean .
our food was fantastic !
the hot and sour soup was amazing .
great customer service but food was bland .
the bread is so buttery and the meat is so good !
)
very impressive customer service .
overall good .
the greens are too hard and do n't hold approach shots .
i liked it and will go again .
still great and will eat here again .
best pizza on the west side , maybe the valley .
the best mexican restaurant .
dinner was great as usual .
all the sides were wrong .
thanks central !
it 's very clean and well organized .
good drinks !
no food ready but asked if i could pay now .
the carrot and celery sticks are mushy and off color .
however , just the other night , i found mold in my pizza .
i loved the meal and the turkish coffee .
good food speaks for itself and i respect that !
rude !
but it reminds me off chinese food prepared for a mexican clientele .
food was good , but service was great .
adopted many animals over the years from this place .
so they obliged and gave me another room ( pro ? )
it was n't worth it .
thank god we left at _num_ _num_ the next morning .
however i will never do business there again .
everything was excellent ; however , the egg rolls were primarily cabbage .
bit pricey but it 's well worth it .
it seemed gross and chewy .
also the oyster beef is very good .
we tried the sausage and cabbage rolls and both were very good .
they graciously walked my team through the installation process as well after the sell .
and the service is always friendly .
what a shame !
always having fresh bread available right away .
it was pretty odd for an almost empty restaurant .
the best the desert has to offer .
if you like olive garden this location is recommended .
not my chips .
finally the food comes , and of course , the order is wrong .
which my mom was sitting at who uses a walker and has trouble moving .
however i am not satisfied with this place .
i specially asked for a non smoking room but our room smells of smoke .
not a family friendly place at all .
it took them two days to come out and fix my fridge .
small menu , but the food is excellent .
it was a _num_ dollar bowl for crying out loud .
perfect cafe food !
do not stay here .
i tell him `` sir , i 'm standing right here in line . ''
great place !
this was absolutely a hidden gem !
the staff is great !
i will be back again !
?
it is an excellent place with a great atmosphere .
bathrooms were disgusting .
sweet service .
very sad .
next , the total was $ _num_ ( i also ordered a blizzard ) .
the bread was amazing and the turkish coffee was out of this world .
i love this place !
i do n't know smh .
sonic has great food and tons of drink and dessert options .
( to eat , not to love , but to eat ) .
i 've always had good service here , and we are here often .
they get new inventory everyday , so it definitely worth checking out .
nice seating , good customer service .
i may shop there again - not ( unless pig 's fly ) .
they tried telling us we drove _num_ miles !
we stay at motel _num_ a lot , but this is the worst .
i would highly recommend ya 'll to check this place out !
i didnt even get utensils .
the pizza is very good , and the wings are my favorite .
man , was he rude .
the selection is just so-so .
also i checked out the restroom .
this kung pao chicken is garbage .
you gave to try their wings so good .
they absolutely have the best kung pao ever !
i would recommend not going to this place ever !
she did agree to adding a order of fries free of charge .
now this place sucks .
it takes many appointments , and takes longer then _num_ minutes to do !
several others walked in behind me also with complaints on orders .
pathetic .
thanks fellas for your above average work !
no flavor .
it 's ghetto and the service is incredibly horrible .
i took my _num_ yr old dog into her first teeth cleaning last week .
motorcycle !
total rip-off !
i have better tacos at home using fry 's brand of taco seasoning .
i 've been coming here for years , good service , good food .
terrible experience do n't recommend to anybody .
there was no sign or anything to say i could n't park there .
i really appreciate it .
so i will say yay i am a fan !
great prices .
asked to speak with he manger he too do not arrive .
service is great as well !
i took one bite and could n't eat anymore .
i asked if she could void the transaction and again i got a no .
having to wait a long time for just my drink .
this is so awesome !
really friendly staff too !
the next morning , we found that the water temperature would n't stay steady .
so i been looking for a year .
great staff - funny old timer men sitting at the bar .
i am very happy with the deals i received .
well worth the trip .
i really appreciate them .
its not some fancy restaurant , but its the best .
this is a place that i frequent for pizza .
i have n't been in awhile because of these reasons .
friendly service , great food !
only one star because i have to .
i love the bar .
their comics are also in poor condition .
the buns are really good , high quality .
based on my last experience i do n't think i will bring my car back.
he enjoyed it very much !
save yourself the $ _num_ .
appetizers , salads , buffalo wings and beers have also always been good .
the service was very very very very very slow , and a wrong order .
good deal and delicious pizza .
fast , healthy , consistent , quality !
pretty darn good .
i do n't know what happened but the mongolian bbq no longer exists .
you had the best old school video games ever .
gross !
everything was incredible , fresh and authentic .
so , his arrival did n't help the problem .
the hotel staff could n't have cared about anyone one .
great service at a very reasonable price .
there was no taste to the food at all .
this place is amazing !
what a disappointment .
mimi does an amazing job every single time .
we had a great conversation and a few laughs .
the sweet and sour pork , taste like chicken nuggets !
this guy is awesome !
consistent & efficient .
their food is consistently good and fairly price .
that 's not that worst part .
very good food .
very sub par place .
my filet , perfect !
i 'm not talking about running a few minutes late either .
the people are really nice too .
there 's reasonable room to park at least just not enough of them .
well done !
i give them a _num_ because the food is delicious !
worst stay of my life , i wish i could get my money back .
it a hole in the wall in the middle of crack haven .
me and my wife come here all the time on special occasions .
little dragon is a family owned restaurant and they are always nice .
i took this photo after sleeping on my hair & it 's still gorgeous !
pancakes covered in strawberries was a nice addition to the meal !
$ _num_ for two _num_ oz steaks _num_ salad bar .
i went once and refused to go back .
awful , food sits and is old .
i am not kidding or exaggerating .
we love texas roadhouse !
if you have n't been here or are thinking of checking it.
a wonderful place to start your family in walking the lord .
an hour was just right for our first ride .
this place is horrible .
really old washers and dryers that seem to run super loudly .
if i could give this a negative star , i would .
after they hook you , they do n't care .
the wings are great too !
that watery vinegar they give at the drive through is less than spectacular .
my dealership referred me and wow were they right .
i am never going to this one again .
the service the last time i went was just terrible .
i am not a fan of milk , but love this milk .
thanks !
all in all , we were really disappointed and will not return .
the toilet in the room did n't stop running .
he did not even bother requesting a price check .
very very good american chinese food .
he stated things like i could n't afford `` quality gyms '' .
it has such a homey taste and fulfilling .
this was the worst one i 've ever been to !
they put their customers before pricing which is great to know .
not thrilled with this place , probably wo n't come here again .
all i ate there was crunchy rice and soy sauce .
great pizza much like the east coast pizza shops .
i do n't recommend .
service is n't good .
ho was great and really helped my wife and i thought a difficult time .
there are tvs on , not loud .
i asked them to put it on rye instead because that would taste better .
i 'm truly blessed to be part of this church .
the food was n't bad , but it did lack flavor .
it has been very educational and insightful .
best place ever .
the best part is definitely the bread .
it was very informative and also very personable .
i 've had much better elsewhere .
my fianc and i had an amazing dining experience .
if it was possible i would give it a negative star .
the tired bartenders are over worked and under staffed .
did n't feel too safe to go for a walk .
food is always good .
this facility is really amazing .
good service .
... not friendly !
walked in and no hello from the bartender .
i would have been better off at kfc .
i never got a call and a repair was never made .
never again will i go there .
horrible service .
avoid coming here if you do n't have to .
the service sucked starting from the second we walked in the door .
so frustrating .
the server was super nice , great service !
as for my food it always taste good !
really good food in huge portions .
by far one of the worst shopping experiences i 've ever had .
they have great customer service , and are great to call in an order .
wings always made to my liking and very crispy .
the cashier asked who is going to eat because there is not sharing ?
i went to wendy 's across the street and had food in _num_ minutes .
as soon as she saw me she knew why i was there .
i 'm in love with their food .
they need to teach their employees some manners and how costumer service works !
did n't care if we needed anything .
the greeter when you walk in does n't smile .
dine in or take out , it 's good food .
i love it and i know you will too .
my pedicure , however , turned out okay with minimal polish on the skin .
the pastrami sandwich was great !
horrible service .
i totally recommend her .
thank you so much !
it just looked like the bed had been made and that 's it .
the new restaurant is quite good .
the food is great .
that is n't cool .
the staff was very professional and informative .
dine in is classy and sophisticated .
how rude !
he fixed them perfectly .
the quality of food at this location is much more consistent than other locations .
was in the area and thought i would stop in for a burger .
good service with big portion great tasting food .
now , the one advantage i thought was present , is not .
the food is consistent .
these boys always treat me well and respectful .
pretty decent and very good , fast service .
big huge mistake .
excellent , inexpensive chinese food buffet .
i was blatantly ignored and when i asked again .
if you like that kinda white trash thing go ahead .
it was disgusting .
also , the dinner salad is good but pricey .
the worst experience i have ever had at a dr 's office !
our waitress was amazing .
the course is in even worse condition from when the pictures were taken .
other pizza places always put dips and napkins when you buy pizza from them .
will be eating here a lot !
as soon as you walk in , you feel welcomed and right at home .
really good italian food !
really , that 's not too much to change , right ?
a great change for a great price !
even the manager i spoke to was n't up to par .
the work these people do are absolutely incredible .
this establishment has always stayed consistent with their food as far as taste .
the gal there was very friendly , i had a lovely moscato sangria .
great service and good people who care about the community .
great atmosphere .
decoration is outdated .
the front office staff has a friendly and helpful attitude .
sorry but extremely pissed at them and will never be back !
i asked for a to go box for a left over roll and shrimp .
nobody called me .
the crew and office staff were so nice !
best place for eyebrows !
very enjoyable riding experience .
soooooo much good food , great coffee , and all for a decent price .
spoke to a person at their office and was told sorry !
will never visit this location again !
again , the pizza is outta this world .
the meat was soft and tender with good flavor .
been here for years but they can never get it right .
that was going to cost me $ _num_ .
love them !
best pediatrician in town !
the customer service was very lousy today .
i gave him the same instructions on how to cut my hair like always .
do n't even hang out in the parking lot .
there were a handful of flies waiting to greet us in our room .
this place has the best pizza dough and great customer service .
love this place !
we shall return again and again !
the taco was crispy and flavorful .
the ice cream ( yogurt ) machine is no more .
the hot sauce is even better !
and we 've tried a few different recipes , all of them amazing .
stay away from here as i will !
me and my husband went here last saturday for an early dinner .
rude .
worst motel ever !
i 'll definitely go back !
there is a walmart across the street !
it was very good ... .
great family run business .
the egg was overcooked .
this place is perfect !
at that point i had it and left with no food .
do not use this company !
this place is amazing !
this place did not and i was unable to finish my $ _num_ cocktail .
each serving could easily feed two .
extremely dense and hard to eat .
please try if you have n't ... it 's so good !
friendly waitress .
great service , great little whole in the wall restaurant .
delicious !
these guys do a great job for $ _num_ .
my husband and i loved the egg drop soup .
nothing to write home about , but i 'll write it on yelp .
for the quality and size of food , great priced !
do n't give them your business .
then i get up to the register .
so do they ; why are you asking ?
the comforter looked _num_ years old and had holes !
they are honest , professional , and quick .
they have a ton of clothing and a pretty decent furniture section .
their crab puffs are delicious too .
ca n't even supply their shoppers with shopping carts .
the portions are good and the chicken is always really good .
the chicken was sliced , grilled , and tasted like it was microwaved .
she did n't even realize that we already had our food .
i walked in and no one greeted us .
i usually avoid this particular one .
i really do n't get why people come here so often .
and left , never to return .
the communication with this store was awful !
the `` sour '' is n't in the name to make it sound pretty .
george is probably the only trustworthy employee in this whole entire complex .
if you do n't ... well be prepared for your order to be wrong .
the customer service is still good as well .
after reading the previous reviews i was a bit concerned .
great food and as is the service .
uber friendly staff , great value for steaks and quick service .
mani and pedi were the best and most relaxing i have ever experienced .
i felt comfortable and safe the whole time .
the sight of the food was just completely unappealing .
too bad !
they are rude and dirty .
i was charged for the cheese too because the total was $ _num_ something .
this was our cue to leave .
also , a free tow to the company .
that should have been my first clue .
places like this are rare these days .
not cuz of the hair but because of the mediocre food .
fast service , and great customer service !
rude hostess and bad customer service .
right up the street from my house ca n't be beat !
so my wings came out _num_ mins before pizza was done .
warm welcoming people with great view !
they also speak spanish !
i love that their veggies in any of their plates are always crunchy .
it was good .
the upside down blizzard was water down .
the best customer service !
food great.
we also had turkish coffee ... it blew my mind .
great great great .
their food is amazing and their ice tea is the best .
i ca n't even imagine what the kitchen looks like .
i did n't have to give you a dime .
the lo mein is amazing as are the cream puffs .
food and service were really good .
friendly service , delicious entrees = heaven !
he sure as hell didnt .
great food , outstanding service !
also way too much cheese .
the pizza is amazing .
you are a true mesa landmark !
nice guy and excellent customer service .
great food great prizes .
if you do n't you wo n't get any .
he was very reasonable with his price , friendly , and fast .
their customer service is excellent !
my tow assistance is set by progressive at 10am .
nice small atmosphere that brings out the bosnian culture .
best whole in the wall chinese food in the west valley !
i have already called like _num_ times .
beautiful cut and incredible color !
everything is fresh and absolutely delicious .
this place does n't deserve one start nevertheless the _num_ star rating on hotwire .
i love everything about it .
i agree with jason b , the service here sucks !
if the tow driver would 've helped , i would of tipped .
great food , clean n great staff !
i love eating at this location .
the best pizza in the phoenix area ... .
shame on you !
windows have n't been cleaned in years you can see scum on them .
# _num_ missing light bulbs in the light fixtures # _num_ .
great food !
ingredients were of low quality with no taste .
horrible customer service !
messages that a young couple with kids can relate to .
i thought walmart cashiers were bad , these take the cake !
has a very fresh feel .
my son worked there and worked with the greatest people .
i would not recommend this place to anyone .
fast and pleasant service to boot ... i will be back .
they do n't take care of their comics .
alex our waiter , did an exceptional job .
i love their food , and it 's always clean and busy .
just flat out rude .
they are very nice and easy to deal with .
it has beautiful scenery with spectacular views of south mountain as well as ahwatukee .
i got one $ _num_ credit but it did n't continue .
very friendly people !
excellent customer service .
not only is the service terrible , the management is terrible .
_num_ .

so disappointed , most likely wo n't be returning .
poor poor customer service .
good beer selection .
food is great !
the worst experience i have ever had at an enterprise location .
i love going to places where the service is great !
she was yelling so loud that the entire restaurant went quiet .
not a big fan .
food is very good and the service is fantastic !
it was disgusting !
this is my favorite chinese place to go so far .
i hate them for not giving me the option by calling me first .
it 's especially fun when we have people visiting from out of town .
but seriously the employees here were excellent .
terrible customer service , staff arguing with each other .
our move was a nightmare was the start .
why do they charge so much to use credit cards ?
will not be eating little caesars ever again .
do n't waste your money .
the wings were just gross .
big mistake .
i can excuse the mess because i know how inconsiderate customers can be .
always good to eat something that is interesting and tasty !
they said the van was there but could n't find us .
this place is amazing .
the office never answers their phone and does n't return any messages .
this was beyond unacceptable !
he made everything great and suggested i give them another shot .
this place is definitely one you should visit outstanding food and great melon water !
wow !
also , the noodles were halfway over cooked .
the take-out is definitely worth it !
i gave _num_ star for the side dishes .
what i was not fine with .
great wall buffet is an excellent value !
for being in a pinch they really were the best .
their fried rice is great .
the waitress just left the mess she made for is to clean up .
love the pizza .
good choice , and i do n't eat chinese food !
friendly staff and they are always on top of refills .
we got some appetizers which were very good as well .
_num_ .
so sad .
love it here !
i usually find some really good deals .
i highly recommend this location !
food cold , tasteless and soggy .
we made the right choice !
the place is dirty and disgusting .
_num_ .
francisco was very professional and really helpful .
no customer service at all .
the service here sucks .
i am always happy to go eat here !
friendly and fast , this location is fast food done right .
specially the house fried rice !
they are always friendly and call me by name .
their pizza is excellent but it is the wings that keep me coming back !
the green salsa is amazing !
maybe she was confused to what i meant ?
always busy dirty and smells like cigarette buds .
they always know what the right wines to recommend for me .
horrible service .
i really like that they will customize your food to how spicy you want .
definitely worth a trip !
it was awful .
like i said , i did my homework .
it did n't taste horrible , just cheap ... so only a minor fail .
the service is super friendly and perfectly attentive while not being overbearing .
the bread was amazing and the turkish coffee was out of this world .
it has better food than these larger buffets .
amazing sauce !
amazing little family owned place !
great prices , good service , and food .
they argued with me and gave me a lame $ _num_ credit !
what a hidden gem !
everyone is super friendly and the food is great !
i also notice that floor was really and there was no wet floor sign .
not to mention that is not even busy !
love this place !
when the food finally arrived , it was n't anything spectacular .
i just wanted to try something different and was very pleased .
sammy is my normal barber but he messed my hair up horribly yesterday .
horrible service !
i opted for the cod .
excellent chinese food !
first , the cashier clearly did n't want to be there .
to top it off the food was prepared with no gloves .
entirely way too long .
from the outside it looks suspect , but its nice inside .
very disappointing food and waste of my time .
manager says she needs it for inventory .
the food is delicious and the staff is attentive to our needs .
my family will continue to support the humane society for the years to come .
the tiles on the steps were cracked and missing chunks .
last week we had the best calzone since we moved here to az .
order _num_ simple things was told 30-45 min which is find .
the customer service is none the girls and the cook are rude .
also the shower had no hot water and no water pressure .
nothing at all .
great alternative to buffet chinese .
i spent almost _num_ min laughing at just _num_ jacket .
amazing sauce and really awesome pizza !
the guys are very professional and nice .
that is just bizarre ... at best .
no one has chow mien as good as may garden 's !
i 'm very impressed with the level of care here !
everyone i know says it 's great too , so it 's that good .
it is served in a tiny cup and tray that is adorable !
i would not have payed more otherwise .
_num_ .
the gentleman who replaced our tires was efficiently fast and paid attention to detail .
great bedside manner .
other than that i do n't know who else could appreciate this place .
the best stuffed cabbage rolls i 've had .
that 's great service .
she is also an canadian / bosnian .
not the food but the service .
i recommend !
well , taco bell is taco bell .
when she returns to work i realize they gave me chicken and shrimp .
still ca n't beat a $ _num_ foot long .
it 's super easy to order , fast and convenient .
we will not be back !
well done .
there was a gentleman smoking outside creepy looking and went into the lobby .
upon entering , the atmosphere was just ok .
really over an hour behind and nothing .
did n't offer hot and sour soup at lunch , only egg drop .
dine in experience is always pleasant and service is great .
great for a quick bite , when craving for some chinese food .
a great place to get takeout .
we love our new puppy !
i got the wings and they did n't disappoint .
do n't waste your money here .
i did n't care for the food , thought it was bland .
the equipment they had was really outdated and painful .
by far the best and only choice for healthy fast food in the area .
i was disappointed with the steak fries as they were mushy .
they 're totally new to this place .
the bread with the cinnamon butter was interesting .
everything tasted great and we were all very satisfied with the food and service .
i will tell all my friends this is delish !
i hate to give them just _num_ star .
will make this place a regular staple .
the beer is still cold and good .
anyway , i saw _num_ shirt that was semi cute .
now i remember why i do n't like olive garden .
it 's a shame to watch this place take the turn it has .
def recommend trying it out , the staff is friendly and welcoming .
slow slow slow !
a year later it fried again .
there was comes a time when you make bad choices .
now this place is just a serious dive with little to no redeeming qualities .
also , someone said the regulars are a joy to hang out with ?
go here and leave happy .
steaks cooked to perfection and friendly awsome service .
really a good word today .
i had a bite of my husbands chicken tacos and it was delicious !
was told it 's a _num_ minute wait .
i really do n't know if it was water .
their old style recipe and cooking process makes for a wonderful pizza experience .
so when i come to arizona it 's nice to get my quick fix .
the hostess was very unfriendly .
otherwise , this place is a joy and the food is so good !
i will not be returning to this location .
awesome team !
again in a super loud voice we were told no .
edit : hi rick , i appreciate your desire for a resolution .
just did n't work out for us .
delicious soft served ice cream .
the retail store is nice too with very helpful employees .
heavy sauces , bland dishes and so-so service .
still , gross !
so i asked again for the manager and explained the situation .
worst ever .
my family of _num_ will not be returning .
looks pretty sketchy on the outside but it 's good as fuck .
my favorite fast food restaurant of all time .
horrible customer service .
the hot n sour soup was okay .
by far the best i 've ever had .
no apology .
she said , `` they 're really busy in the back . ''
only had one bartender and no server .
come on people , the is the usa and thats coming from a hispanic !
no touching , no going ahead of people , no laughter , no dancing .
the food is good , way better than panda express !
the lady that works here is such a sweetheart !
definitely recommend to friends and family .
the restrooms were a disaster !
you get what you pay for ... stayed here to visit family in goodyear .
good food for the price .
i will not recommend anyone to this location or any of their franchise period .
great food and great service !
very happy with the service and product .
had the worst experience with safeway this week .
my pasta was so dry that it was almost sticking together .
you 've got ta love di .
awesome food , great staff , great atmosphere .
hands down one of the best places around .
connie is a cool lady , she 's been there for years .
i had her order the steak and shrimp with veggie bowl for me .
i seen him interact with other tables and everyone seems very pleased .
the waitress then offered to refill our bread basket .
great place !
only taking cash at the moment which sucks !
but , all _num_ wings were bad .
_num_ stars .
which is also a place i would not want to ever go back to .
stopped by for a local , fire grilled burger .
great place super friendly .
_num_ .
pleasant staff and decent atmosphere .
its a great course , some beautiful views and amazing holes .
but i do n't feel my vehicle is safe outside .
you can tell they love the animals .
excellent food , excellent prices and large sized portions .
i will eat there again .
floor and ceiling look like they have been rode hard and hung up wet .
waiter dropped off food and never came back !
i also love to have a nice cup of hot tea too .
if we had waited any longer , they all would have been dead !
friendly folks .
_num_ of us can all share one meal , lol sometimes .
this is my second trip to this place and both wee bad experiences .
was not impressed .
these donuts have the perfect texture and taste .
the waiter said i could n't take the shrimp home because it was unlimited .
wonderful people , cause and place !
it 's just not an enjoyable place to play .
amazing service and food !
they are cheap .
our server , andrea , quickly greeted us and was very very pleasant .
so we sat there for _num_ minutes before she even sat us .
the service is pretty good , even at busy times .
very clean place too !
so rude !
horrible service and dirty facility .
all in all the service and food was great !
the lady who takes your order is rude .
yelp is my review , my story , and my life .
we should have gotten up and walked out to go someplace else .
as well as the other employees there .
one of my favorite quick stops in phoenix !
its so worth it .
i will be contacting groupon to get a refund .
after moving from california i definitely needed a great donut shop !
great experience !
delicious .
the menu has nothing healthy on it .
the waitress was very friendly and attentive .
the pizza was great and the wings were the best i 've ever had .
i have played this course several times and i really enjoy it .
great simple chinese food .
thank you to tony and the staff for the exceptional service we got .
the employees are top notch in the industry .
the front door was broken off of the cabinet that held the fridge .
the prices are pretty cheap and the food is flavorful and traditional .
no mashed potatoes .
never again after that have i ate there .
it 's one place in the valley where you can get decent chinese food !
my favorite safeway to shop at !
now i want to give it a zero .
returns are easy with or without receipts .
worst food and customer service ever .
horrible wont ever go back .
the place usually has live music and it 's loud !
nothing extraordinary .
it took us about _num_ min to get the foods on the table .
i ran out of this place and i will never ever come back !
there prices were fair and their customer service was incredible !
they have quality freshly made food for low prices !
everything was good .
_num_ + 's from us !
we waited _num_ minutes we were not even offered any water or anything .
the portions are great you get a lot of food for your money .
mediocre quality , at best .
great deal !
this means for over a month i will have no refrigerator .
drug deals out in the parking lot .
all over , the ambiance was pleasant .
i like mine with extra sauce .
great prices .
this place will hit the spot !
cons : the first room they put me in stunk of cat urine !
i used to love the mussels appetizer , but this visit they were awful .
do not go here for food .
the gel nail polish i got was perfect !
if i could give it a _num_ i would .
but i can try to texture it . ''
if i could give _num_ stars i would .
the food has never been much more than convenient .
i have been there twice and the food was plentiful and oh so fresh .
the orange chicken , sesame chicken and fried rice are very good as well .
as im using the restroom one of the workers com in to clean .
the service was great and the food has never disappointed .
wth , potatoes or hash browns & eggs are what makes a breakfast burrito .
the staff is extremely rude and unorganized !
overall a very nice surprise .
my torta was n't too big but but was very filling .
this is a great and blessed church of god !
the best has to be the bosnian sausages .
i could deal with the really basic room .
i would rather be dirty than stay one more min in this place .
i feel very welcomed every time i go .
i found the food here very tasty and reasonably priced .
this place is the worst place i have ever been too .
i highly recommend them !
quality and quantity is given here .
he is honest and practical .
i probably wo n't be back for another _num_ .
thanks !
the soups and the bread were fantastic .
will definitely be back .
had we had any other choices , we would have taken them .
no elevator .
got helped out by francisco and he was very friendly and efficient .
he was helpful at first but than treated us as if we were stupid .
it was really disgusting , so i contacted my manager .
my feet feel so much better after she 's done .
buyer beware , you buy as is .
the cheese bread was yummy as well !
avoid coming to this ghetto target !
probably the worst olive garden i have been to .
kung delight thumbs up .
the salsa is spicy , the beans and rice delicious .
the crust is totally amazing and so awesome in my mouth !
i would n't trust danny 's to do anything to my truck .
you get the ranch because it 's freaking amazing there .
i will recommend this shop to anybody looking to have jewelry sized or repaired .
this seems to be a trend among courses that i do n't like .
both are good and usually can feed 3-4 people if portioned properly .
i absolutely love this place !
the staff is really friendly .
try a guinness or a porter , really .
they have new pedicure chairs and the staff is always nice .
the arizona humane society 's campus for compassion is a fantastic animal shelter .
worship is awesome and followed by a great message .
i never understood party favors .
we will be searching for another vet and not coming back to this location .
that should have been washed properly , someone could get sick .
the lady that did my pedi did not even put a top coat on .
poor service .
the cashier was very friendly .
very excited to finally wear my watch .
for the soup , i went with the chicken & gnocchi .

like wtf am i going to do with cherry sauce ?
they are friendly and always welcoming .

it was fantastic !
i hardly doubt they reached their limit on a tuesday but who knows .
service , adequate ; food , tasty .
the meat is dark , fatty , and does n't even taste like chicken .
the food was excellent - wor wonton soup with noodles and singapore rice noodles .
my son had a horrible experience with the staff at this complex .
the arizona humane society is a great place to adopt .
great food and it has a diner atmosphere .
overall a great experience .
thank you for the great meal !
the food is great .
the fried outer layer was overcooked , over salted and smooth .
bonus !
horrible service , very difficult to deal with .
their customer service via phone or in person is excellent .
it is quiet and great to take friends .
not smart and maybe not final .
good location !
no one greeted us or even acknowledged us !
excellent tortas served with homemade potato chips .
rainbow donuts offers amazing these donuts in various flavors and fillings .
he did amazing work at a very reasonable price .
it is tacky to the touch and uneven .
great little chinese food place in our neighborhood with decent prices .
never was waited on while the service desk person took customers out of order .
the beef was overcooked and chewy .
loved it !
i felt bad for the owners of this arizona staple .
the burrito was big but only fair tasting .
do not use this company at all seriously call someone else .
perfect for my needs .
worst experience ever !
i just had the worst experience ever .
i had great service here today .
i love this place !
this was perfect .
it sure was quick , but , come on !
delivery man was very friendly .
all the _num_ star reviews are very odd to me .
clean , friendly , and well organized !
movie night !
they came off very honest and genuine , i 'll always be a customer !
i really hate coming here .
left them a voicemail and never returned my call .
great people !
the food is great .
no go !
cool small spot .
definitely one of the best tire shop and location .
everyone was so helpful and so kind .
i wo n't be stopping there again .
the food is always great and a fair price .
great bosnian food , excellent friendly service .
it 's small but food is awesome for the price .
both were amazing .
the meat was like a lunch meat instead of real sliced deli beef .
the food is delicious , fresh , and obviously authentic .
service was good , food was pretty good , price was reasonable .
egg roll was crispy and delicious .
that tells me you are not paying attention to what you are doing .
the staff is extremely friendly and helpful .
this hotel was the worst hotel we stayed in .
no complaints perfect for price !
may i recommend the apricot chicken or mixed grill ?
i did n't bother to shower there .
after _num_ of these i was going a little insane .
the waitress kept checking on me ensuring everything was good .
the worst place i ever stayed .
their salsas are not spicy or flavorful .
but do n't risk the car running out of gas to come here .
best wings i have had in a long time .
and like i said we always enjoy coming here .
went tonight on a recognition and was horribly disappointed .
they look great tho .
it was our first time at red lobster , and probably our last .
the food in my opinion is so commercial .
it was n't good .
the food was good and full of flavor .
the noodles were disgusting .
ca n't wait to move out .
fresh made bread for the tortas and refreshing fruit drinks !
husband ordered the ribeye and it too was cooked well done .
i am also happy they are taking credit cards now now .
staff is always friendly .
i recently moved in the area and was looking for a good sub shop .
all of these are tasty .
i also asked for hot sauce , guess what i got instead ?
always a good thing .
he was so professional and nice and i felt completely comfortable with his adjustment .
no wonder they are closing down everywhere .
left really full .
do not use this company !
this is a corporate vet and everything bad that corporate vets do .
in sum , a very bad experience .
i will refer the world to them .
we pretty much love all their food .
the worse service ever !
last i checked _num_ minutes was _num_ hour and _num_ minutes .
_num_ .
i really expected so much more but was completely disappointed .
we love this place .
service is always spot on too .
very great sandwiches esp .
it was like our couch was made from three leftover pieces they had .
just try it and fall in love !
the employees at this service station truly care about there customers .
what a gem this place is .
some nice coins priced at market values .
it just would n't be worthwhile .
this location is horrible .
he could n't breath .
great food .
plus he was n't very helpful with putting my car in the driveway .
i enjoyed their pollo bowl !
i paired the meal with earl soup and an iced tea !
score !
i guess everyone is so used to their mcdonalds and microwave dinners .
it 's our family 's favorite pizza !
best time to come is lunch when they have all their specials on .
gravy and side of corn were so salty it ruined the meal .
i kept telling her no but she continued to insist she must come in .
to be honest the only thing that was good was the fountain drinks .
the service is excellent and food was superb .
he did n't care that my daughter had gotten sick .
okay !
nightmares of hungry people and no food ... .
is n't that a little bit unethical ?
it did n't take long to figure out what it was .
abandoned motel next door with its windows busted out .
every time we come and enjoy the services here the experience is pleasant .
i love their sauce , which is fairly sweet with good tomato notes .
favorite mexican in town , best value too .
_num_ hours after we ordered they want to know where to take the pizza .
it 's worth the drive .
even the frozen yogurt did n't taste very good .
first impression when i walk into the place is the smell of dirty carpets .
there was no chicken on the inside .
my son 's smothered steak was da bomb !
when we received our order of wings , they were cold .
_num_ stars to rob and his family !
just went back this weekend .
food was delicious .
no service !
also the manager is racist & they do not accept section _num_ anymore .
so i ordered a salad instead .
_num_ $ bucks !
we found _num_ in a corner , the rest was n't cleaned .
the guy said sorry for the wait but he did n't mean it .
another _num_ minutes goes by .
service here sucked .
Negative
pharmacy staff is rude .
without a doubt the best milk i have ever had .
i wish i could give this place negative stars .
the cheese is different , the crust is different .
use that gift card for your movie tickets .
horrible system with seating .
my food experience was just so strange and terrible at the same time .
he checked out the watch and then put in a new battery .
i had the biscuit egg , bacon , and cheese sandwich and the waffle .
so gross today .
i love this place .
i loved everything !
got the salad , it was ok .
do not order from here they are the worst !
i now bring my family and sure the great food and memories with them .
some of the doctors are ok im referring to the business as a whole .
they maintain consistency and you can always expect an excellent meal .
he was a total ass .
awesome food !
beyond great food .
pizza was disgusting .
she was not even friendly !
the place is nicely decorated , clean , and cozy .
we were delighted with our choice .
ca n't get basic orders correct .
great alternative to the chain restaurants .
they do n't add much to the meal .
i live close and will definitely be back for lunch .
i also noticed these prices were pretty stiff .
i had to choose _num_ star otherwise , i could n't post this review !
the food was cold and did not meet expectations .
this restaurant is a staple in the community .
worth the price thats for sure .
but , the shrimp linguini totally blew .
only wish i could have given them _num_ stars .
they welcome you with open arms and are always there when your in need .
awesome place !
very clean .
awesome service !
but i have to get this off my chest .
the pizza sauce is seasoned just right .
my husband , and family continue to go to him .
great place for family dining .
he was always reassuring me while in the chair .
yes , hoping someone would hear me .
i love the wings but they are n't worth the beyond terrible service .
do n't buy the groupon .
this location does n't even come close to being awesome .
she was not a fan of the hummus she had or the greek salad .
well it does n't .
after slow service this morning i decided to look up this business on yelp .
ordered our food.
five stars for carrying new mexico hatch chile !
bill is so cute and sweet , kind and an amazing artist .
nasty people .
the best place for high-end work shoes - especially boots - and hiking shoes .
why would n't she tell me that from the beginning ?
oh god in heaven : no !
for the price , i did n't expect much .
great service and great food !
quaint .
get a life , worse pizza in town !
so far the food i have eaten here has been good !
the lady that answered was extremely rude and did n't care one dam bit .
and another _num_ mins just to get our check .
i have never not had to wait in a 10+ minute wait line .
please beware they are looking for a buck at your expense !
needless to say we spent too much money for a not very satisfying meal .
the service was friendly but the food was not worth the money .
flavorful , juicy , superior steak .
that being said , the eggrolls were crunchy and the cabbage tasted good .
good variety and food was good .
liked it .
alberto the manager and his team are phenomenal !
will continue shopping here !
francisco was a great help .
i went to red lobster today with my family the service was horrible .
they get _num_ stars for the huge portions .
especially kayla in grooming !
also they do not have gluten free soy sauce .
it was a empty bar .
no green grass at all .
the cafe is really cute inside .
anyway , the service lacked in every way .
i do n't know , though , just my opinion .
we love this place and will continue to go back .
this place is a rip off .
awesome staff .
the drive thru service is fast and friendly .
not impressed .
nice service and staff , beer selection is great .
could use less sugar but whatever works .
i will definitely be back .
i will not come back .
the grocery prices are excellent !
i was impressed when i saw how good a job they did .
this does not make any sense .
it 's always clean , the food looks fresh and tastes great every time .
the food was great but andy made our night perfect !
they were quite disgusting .
haha could give another star for convenience but parking is bad !
but on the bright side they do have hot peppers as an option .
this company is amazing .
good food but poor cleanliness apparently .
no silverware .
- food is generally pretty good .
the staff were so gracious and extremely helpful !
but the rest of my family like the regular ones .
it does help out with you have children .
you can actually fold the slice down the center just like ny pizza !
here is an awesome story .
i will continue to take my animals here .
the ice cream and sides are great too .
excellent , fast work at a great price !
this sonic is good .
i will definitely bring my kitty back for all of his care here .
the service was nice but not worth coming back .
will always return , as stated , it has become a tradition for us !
crappy customer service .
great first experience .
good food and fast service ... !
thank you fellow yelper 's for this recommendation !
ask for fried rice with your meal they give you chicken fried rice .
i tried to complain and the chick acted like she did n't speak english .
the service excellent and the waitress was very attentive .
- great prices .
i show up a few minutes late and still wait an additional 10-15 minutes .
i was very disappointed with my manicure .
i 'll definitely be back .
he received great care and was a completely different dog by that evening .
mmmmm authentic stuff .
i 'm very very happy with coin gallery .
excellent food and wonderful service .
they were quick , affordable , and honest !
_num_ star for that and another for the yummy biscuits .
the all you can eat is awesome .
definitely the best italian market in phoenix !
in general , this petsmart just was not a fun place to be .
always have a good experience when i go and buy !
the mango margarita is the best !
i asked why he was being so rude .
do not eat here .
i ordered them with no guacamole , add extra cheese .
this places is amazing calzones are so tasteful !
but she said unfortunately they had no more sauce ?
they always mess up my order and give me the wrong food .
friendly staff .
that 's too bad cause this is the closest sears to my house .
i do n't want to spend 10-15 additional minutes of my lunch hour waiting .
the food is amazing and super tasty .
some of the language was suspect , but other than that it was great !
this is amazing '' .
promised glasses would be ready for pickup within _num_ to _num_ business days .
i 'll never b going back .
the food was pretty good and the servings are huge !
their service is also very good .
not be racist but are they trying to hire any whites any time soon ?
nothing special .
i 'm very dissapointed .
only reason i gave a star was yelp forced me too
i pushed ignore .
the guy in front of us was ordering in spanish .
get something to go or stay for awhile , your mouth will thank you .
the wings are sorry .
they keep messing up orders .
this company is complete fraud .
good wings and good burgers !
take out is great and i would recommend getting take out there .
she walked out and left me in there for half an hour .
good salsa , and rice .
best pizza in the valley !
thanks so much again !
beside that great food .
no toppings , just soft serve vanilla ice cream .
i could n't find a mirror to save my life !
i would normally give og a 3-4 .
i bought some _num_ % and it 's really good fresh local milk .
what a shame of a business you are running linda .
this particular location has excellent customer service .
this is good food and i would recommend it to anyone !
this is a oil change express station with two servicing stations .
it was terrible .
great ... .
omg i 'm hooked .
i would n't refer anyone to use this company .
the service is fast and friendly .
this store sucks .
wonderful service from the most friendly staff i 've ever seen .
the coupon says it 's only good tonight at the game .
best taco i 've ever had .
wrong !
service is friendly !
if i ever come to phoenix to visit i will not be staying here .
great decor and kind service !
this place when using their coupon is an amazing value .
but what was n't acceptable was the salt level in the food .
thank you very much .
highly recommend it !
we get back home and the order was wrong .
i had the sweet and sour chicken and it was soooooo good .
there were bad grapes mixed in with good ones .
it shows she enjoys her job !
it was our first time here and we are definitely coming back .
it was the same if not worse .
one of our family favorites .
when i took my first bite i was brought back to so many memories .
a great value !
no pay at pump .
always delicious .
almost like a smokey smell mixed with bad bo .
all of it was great .
where i come from they skate , not here .
cool atmosphere .
this would have been the second time the tried to double charge me .
this food is so delicious .
i have always received excellent service at this denny 's .
i fell instantly in love with the atmosphere and the service was really great .
there pizza & wings are amaze !
dr h is the best .
i was very satisfied with everything this place has to offer .
but yesterday was a disaster .
love this place !
all dishes were excellent !
not sure ?
has a great selection of what i need .
so i do not recommend this location plus , they hardly have anything .
i 'll be a happy customer for life !
the potatoes were cold and so was the macaroni and cheese .
great family owned restaurant and great food at decent prices .
mothers has been a great place forever .
food is always prompt , hot and good .
the staff is friendly and the sound is ok .
everything on the menu is something you can recommend to your friends .
so much better than subway .
there food is fresh and the service is great .
of course , i called management and they said they would security immediately .
the service was good and i left filling plump !
i recommend this organization to everyone i know .
so disappointing .
the have good sports , great music and cheap beer !
food is ok but service is something that is lacking .
will not be back ever and filed a complaint !
friendly device , great food , and nice background music !
do n't bother to remember this place .
disgusting !
great challenge of golf especially from the tips .
music is good old school and i 'll keep going back !
are you freaking kidding me ?
prices are very reasonable .
the decor was a lot nicer than i was expecting too .
this was a waste of time .
pretty fast service.
consumer beware because the great customer service i was promised is non-existent .
got ta love pizza mart !
three of my large furniture pieces were damaged .
incredible service by francisco .
this is the best chinese food i have tasted in a long time .
this pharmacy is awful .
this food is on par with both pei wei and p.f .
we saw the most beautiful country !
the wings sucked .
the delivery was fast and the pizza was perfect !
the waiter would disappear and hardly checked on us .
just gross .
a month later , i still had not received my dryer back .
never again in this dump .
its not hard to take an order .
it did n't ring up so the cashier called someone .
he was extremely rude , and he hung up on me !
they really need a waitress to run the floor .
the house fried rice and egg rolls are the best in phoenix .
but nothing show stopping .
what a lovely experience .
will not be coming back to this location .
when i checked my order the fries were cold .
do not spend your hard earned money at this location .
all in all , a great alternative to the big guys .
so cute .
highly recommend .
i always say communication is the best way to get what you want !
ken is great !
love trying local places so we stopped in .
it 's very loud , unclean and humans there buy everything .
do n't ever ever ever stay at this hotel .
extremely disappointed .
a little over an hour wasted sitting waiting ... absolutely horrible customer service .
can never get things fixed .
customer service area sucks .
neither of them acknowledged me .
the lemonade tasted like dirt .
failure one was not checking the address or even bothering to take one .
they seem to sincerely care about my cat .
the food is fantastic and very reasonably priced .
hardly any sauces , and it 's totally ugly inside .
damn you dinner rolls !
also not good .
after this experience , we 're not sure if we want to return .
probably the best chinese food in the west valley !
he always knows the secrets .
employees were friendly and quick with the orders .
the food here is n't very good .
place is decent sized not too packed and always clean .
i would stay away from this restaurant .
everyone there was amazing and the horses were super friendly .
for some reason , my room had some strawberry jelly all over the place .
their sweet tea was good .
great value and super good food .
thank god they use central towing in their network .
this is easily the worst motel _num_ i have ever stayed in .
i asked them how long it would take ryan told me _num_ mins .
i pay my bill monthly on time .
the greens were barely being watered .
he knows quality , and he knows customer service .
super close to home and did such a great job .
_num_ .
overall would never visit that location again and would n't advise you to either .
to start off i wish i could give them zero stars .
avoid this place .
that was _num_ weeks ago .
the cashier do n't understand you and the order was messed up .
while the food itself seems to taste okay .
do n't waste your time or money here .
yummy , yummy rolls !
overall value is really good , and it satisfied me for lunch .
i got the mongolian beef and it really was the best i 've had .
the rest of the food items were just gross .
rude .
the meat is always very fresh .
the bathroom was disgusting .
best wings in town .
i was a little disappointed with the quality and portion .
i do n't know how they got such good reviews .
man this place used to be great .
awesome !
we waited for _num_ minutes and ended up leaving with no food .
the manager was nice enough - no big deal .
if you want a great breakfast in a comfy place .
i always have fresh warm sweet & sour with spring rolls .
the food portions are huge for a great price .
call the front desk and request one , this is approx .
majority of produce is fresh i loved the fresh okra .
it 's for sure the next best thing to making it yourself .
i 've been coming for many many years and they have the best wings .
this place was like a ghost town and no one could even acknowledge us .
i left my purchases there along with another customer .
good drive through with fast service .
my husband & i just finished an excellent lunch at red lobster .
great dr. and staff .
you know he loves me !
without complaining , i had received a coupon for a free large pizza .
pastor joe and pastor fred deliver powerful messages .
the stink when i opened the door to my room was really awful .
tvs are now bigger and better big upgrade from when i last stayed here .
this is the best barber shop in phoenix .
the salad bar was full , rotated , hot , & delicious .
love it !
good service .
i ca n't understand how they 're still in business .
two other customers had incorrect orders at the same time too .
girl is yelling in the background `` that 's what she ordered ! ''
the front desk never called to check if the situation had been resolved .
they are always courteous and have real conversations with you .
they were very careful and gentle .
ordered the family pack which included _num_ wings , fries and garlic bread .
the worst customer service ever !
everything is delicious from the soup to the pitas !
these apartments are quiet and well kept .
unfortunately it 's the closest one to our house .
great service .
all are delicious !
was a great help and excellent tow truck driver .
i was good to go in less than an hour .
perhaps not the best place to eat in doors but good take out food .
they are not compassionate or understanding to my condition .
i immediately stopped eating and threw it in the trash and left disgusted .
the neighborhood is bad and it reflects in their attitude toward their customers .

this has to be the worst pizza hut location i have been to .

i could n't even eat part of my meal .

i was very unsatisfied with the food .
needless to say , we all stopped eating and felt sick to our stomachs .

i the steam rooms door has been cracked for over three months now .
the owner wo n't return calls and the staff wo n't help .
this place is a keeper !
we left at 6am cutting our _num_ night start to one .
unfortunately my last experience on friday was horrible !
not really i heard you talking about your relationship .
one of the worst animal hospitals i have ever been too !
not a great selection , but cheaper than sweet tomato .
a year later the transmission is still doing great !
do n't eat the pizza , or hang out .
i would give this place zero stars if i could .

_num_ .
i had never been to a texas roadhouse quite like this one .
maybe it was a bad day , but .
we walked in and the place was dirty and not well lit .
walked across the street and am sure glad i did .
i ordered a crispy chicken classic with fries and headed back to work .
i told him that is not my issue .
i was so pleased by the way it was served .
my husband thought the soup was good and the egg roll was crispy .
i have recommended him to many of my friends over the years .
hits the spot if you are a real carnivore .
the fried rice is the best around , not greasy , just delicious !
this place has been a favorite for years !
first off the happy hour deals are pretty good .
hate the service .
i would never take my jewelry here again .
we could n't tell who worked there and who did n't .
maintenance replaced the phone .
_num_ % tip from your bill is more then enough if you ask me .
bad sign # _num_ .
i highly recommend you try this place .
the foot locker there has really good service .
they 've always been courteous , straightforward and honest with me .
no refills on drinks were offered while we were there .
by far the worst dining experience i 've ever had in my entire life .
make sure you have time to burn , my mani/pedi took over two hours !
my pizza was cold .
they get your food right and it is good .
i ordered a large pepperoni for $ _num_ .

no wonder the food was so bad .
good pizza & friendly staff .

the beans were too runny as well .
this place is amazing !
this hotel sucks .
lunch specials come with more food than one should eat !
there is another good thing about the restaurant ... the service .
this is seriously the best subway i have ever been to .
from outside this place looks sketchy at best .
he treated us like we were his family .
i built my pie online and set up a carryout option with cash payment .
great service too .
that is a plus .
they 're food is always freshly cooked and cooked well .
to the lazy manager you lost a loyal customer over shrimp !
i must same the service we received today was excellent .
slow service , mediocre mexican food .
then she asks me what entree .
this place is run down for a safeway .
walgreen 's is dead to me .
service was great .
the place was n't even busy at this time .
she tries to upsell me on the meal , i say no .
this is ridiculous !
great bang for your buck .
whatever you can imagine being bad ... it is .
great deli and grocery .
which i expected , i have been to corporate vets before .
it 's definitely one of the best around the area !
was not immediately impressed when i walked in .
it was that bad .
!
i ca n't do that .
the young girl working is rude .
it is wonderful !
it was totally bland and was overwhelmed with ricotta cheese .
the place in general was not clean .
fried shrimp was over cooked .
the items marked as hot are hot !
it 's so clean , so bright , so happy !
we 'll not go back .
they need table cloths , spotless glasses , uniforms , and managing .
she spoke english when she took my money .
after _num_ minutes my pizza was out but only the pizza and no wings .
not joking _num_ freakin minutes i was in there and i was gone .
they deserve a star .

i 'm definitely coming back !
customer service was excellent .
food , i did n't like .
i paid _num_ for a no _num_ combo with a beyond small shake .

it 's a beautiful location with a real focus on animals of all kinds .
i do n't know what happened but the crust is not the same .
( he was under a year old ) .
we literally could n't eat our dinner .
they have amazing breakfast , very good coffee and a variety of meals .
i would be embarrassed to call this my golf course .
the rest was pretty good considering time of year .
the service is very polite and attentive .
also , most of the machines are taken all the time .
only reason i gave them _num_ star is because i had to .
always greeted as if they are happy we are here .
i 'm fat enough .
the place looks like a good old family owned restaurant .
informed the driver thru person and obviously did n't care .
we both were so impressed , we are planning to be frequent visitors here !
delicious !
you should do your best to avoid this wal-mart .
the store is very busy from 8am to about 10pm at night .
this even longer story short , they changed my oil .
the price is good .
poor customer service .

the furniture is unique and looks like one of a kind .
_num_ .
very delicious !
i just had a horrible experience with this location .
the place was crowded on monday morning ( labor day ) .

the fiesta potatoes are never cooked all the way through .

horrible customer service today !
i have adopted one dog and one cat from here .
so me and the wife went here _num_ weeks ago .

this place deserves a big fat zero rating .
under it 's current management it 's a complete ripoff .
his customers service skills are poor at best .
i love waffle house !
the people who work here are so extremely friendly .
flat out stinks , as in smells bad .
affordable german auto is great .
will definitely be back .
the war wonton soup is the best in the valley !
they 've gotten my order wrong every time !
it might actually be worse than little caesar 's or peter piper .
we had the most amazing dining experience here all because of our server andy !
over priced and disorganized !
i travel _num_ miles further to the peoria location which is much nicer .
the food was also good .
that seems incredibly unacceptable .

club west is one of my favorites in the valley .

the orange chicken was barely warm .
i drive back there and wait in line to return my food .
stay as far away from this place as possible .
the cheese was barely melted and the sauce tasted store bought .
the food was delicious too !

everytime we go our experience has been great !

it 's a fun place with old arcade games and lots of seating .
the owner was very rude !
victor in the paint department never called back like he said .
this is just not a good way to run a business .

pretty open yet challenging .
the place is very clean , the staff is very helpful and patient .

the pizza and boneless wings are very good .
just wanted to send a big thank you to francisco !
my husband and i went to dq and we went through the drive through .

they all have good quality food that makes for a good dinner .
they kinda make you feel like family .
instead , they made everything so much hard and more painful .
the place is definitely divey , but it was pretty spotless .
great wall buffet is an excellent value !
after he had just patiently stood there waiting for her for over _num_ minutes .
she just was n't good with people .
had an attitude and got orders wrong .
everything was fantastic , especially the bread !

would definitely recommend .
one of my favorite places in the valley .
the whole company employees and all where very nice and effective .
she became defensive .
we love tokyo express !
past _num_ days they have opened late .
when we received our order it was missing country gravy on both our hashbrowns .
it 's a rare treat to receive quality service in the fast-food industry .
the broccoli tasted like it was not washed .
the only thing different is that they refilled the paper towel dispenser .
the sandwiches are great for eating in .
the fries were hot and fresh and service was great too .
these must have been frozen at some point , they were watery and tasteless .
that said , the carpets were disgusting .
