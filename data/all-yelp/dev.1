when entering , i was willing to give the techs a chance .
has a great selection of what i need .
our first time there and we 'll be returning !
this theater is awesome .
could use less sugar but whatever works .
not only is customer service great but the arcade games !
do not use this company !
and the turkish coffee is all about the good feels ; so damn tasty .
i 'm impressed with how fast they can make the food .
so they obliged and gave me another room ( pro ? )
by far one of the best places to get a torta in arizona .
when we received our order of wings , they were cold .
i would recommend this to anyone !
never again will i go here .
super cool .
denise did n't remember ever speaking with me .
afterwards , i went about my various errands for the day .
went upstairs to bring the mattress down .
new equipment has been remodeled .
highly recommended to anyone with a german auto .
i would not recommend this salon , nor will i be returning .
( point here : texas roadhouse does n't have them ) .
called in a delivery order from this location and it was late .
long story short , _num_ of us returned our meals as they were nasty .
the staff is friendly and very helpful !
bad sign # _num_ .
i ordered a crispy chicken classic with fries and headed back to work .
my wife and i thought the sauce tasted more like ketchup than pizza sauce .
great food , outstanding service !
their old style recipe and cooking process makes for a wonderful pizza experience .
left really full .
the steak was seriously one of the best steaks ive had .
and love him and his staff .
i love that their veggies in any of their plates are always crunchy .
and its not the first time that service was bad there .
_num_ .
nice atmosphere .
this place is awsome !
excellent , fast work at a great price !
i 'm usually a big fan of olive garden .
always good to eat something that is interesting and tasty !
no , just the regular oil change , thanks .
the exam was decent , but after that it was all downhill !
but now there 's no way i 'll ever go back .
huge portion !
it added unfortunate stress to an already stressful day .
this is when things started to get ugly .
loved the prices and being able to walk out to my yard .
definitely will be going back .
highly recommended .
we gave up on getting him off our backs and walked out without ordering .
i found the food here very tasty and reasonably priced .

the green salsa is amazing !
ate there with co-worker and we had fresh fries and everything was delicious !
nice place to stay , good price for .
the all you can eat is awesome .
there were extremely loud children so there 's no ambience .
never again will i go there .
their delivery service is always on time , pleasant , and focused .
_num_ hours after we ordered they want to know where to take the pizza .
love the beverage choices too !
my family will continue to support the humane society for the years to come .
best idea ever .
he makes this stressful experience better !
there are tvs on , not loud .
i love waffle house !
when i entered the store , i did not smell one sense of food .
none of that .

i was left with seafood salad and coleslaw .
the furniture is unique and looks like one of a kind .
thank you .
the fried rice is the best around , not greasy , just delicious !
highly recommended .
stopped by for a local , fire grilled burger .
if this is a recipe change it is not a good one .
will not come back ... this place has no windows ?
just a mess avoid at all costs !
equipment was disgusting .
he did amazing work at a very reasonable price .
the staff is very friendly and attentive .
the maids left the trash in the hallways all night .
there was no taste to the food at all .
the experience was awful and they should have more caring people handling our requests .
this is my go to spot for chinese food .
my husband and i love this place and have been coming for years .
very sub par place .
the greens are too hard and do n't hold approach shots .
the wings was n't that good .
good service with big portion great tasting food .
better !
great portions and food taste great .
i walked in and they told me they 're closed .
rude management , tasteless food , overpriced .
waitress asked if i would like to box it up and i politely declined .
they were both very good .
hot .
they keep messing up orders .
phones calls most of the times ignored , they never returned my call .
glad they stayed consistent .
i 'm very dissapointed .
beside that great food .
awesome place !
thank you mcdonald 's for actually doing the jobs you were hired to do !
make sure you have time to burn , my mani/pedi took over two hours !
the best part is definitely the bread .
this was pretty neat to me .
it 's very clean and well organized .
they are definitely a big hit at our office !
excellent place .
i loved everything !
this is the absolute worst walgreens i 've ever been to .
i receive great customer service .
ca n't get basic orders correct .
happy eats !
wait lets not talk about it !
we did n't have to wait very long before our meal was delivered .
terrible customer service couldnt even tell me how much was on a gift card .
highly recommend .
looks scary from the outside , but it is good !
my second visit just got worse .
true authentic italian deli .
the chicken was dry and way overcooked .
i do bring my friends and family here they always love it !
right up the street from my house ca n't be beat !
got home , opened the package and found i actually got what i ordered .
will be back when in town .
everything we ordered was perfect and everything on their menu is a great deal .
absolutely amazing .
i would give this place zero stars if i could .
yummy , yummy rolls !
the pepper beef i found completely bizarre : the meat was almost smooth .
so close to my house , i 'll definitely become a regular !
it is great .
seriously love this place !
the service is friendly with a smile .
the tiles on the steps were cracked and missing chunks .
after _num_ of these i was going a little insane .
wonderful meal !
they were rude and unapologetic .

delicious !
i could n't find a mirror to save my life !
go here , eat one , now .
i 've been coming for many many years and they have the best wings .
great value .
this place was amazing .
the cheesy bread was cheesy , crappy , and salty all rolled into one .
good service and fast .
sparkling clean counters , and a friendly greeting .
the place was clean and very big for a bigger party .
all the _num_ star reviews are very odd to me .
i feel very welcomed every time i go .
took _num_ minutes to get our drinks and the order was wrong .
whatever you can imagine being bad ... it is .
so i been looking for a year .
they also speak spanish !
but i do n't feel my vehicle is safe outside .
very nice !
i used to love olive garden but its become so blah .
the staff were so gracious and extremely helpful !
it had very little sauce and very little cheese .
the food is good , way better than panda express !
for some reason , my room had some strawberry jelly all over the place .
food is always prompt , hot and good .
just went back this weekend .
this place was freezing cold inside !
i would give this place a negative score if possible .
really good italian food !
rude !
the worse service ever !
i really do n't get why people come here so often .
i recommend their vegetable soup it is great !
if you go in make sure you do not get brian !
i guess that is not the case .
it is amazing and is n't to high in sodium .
i rate this a solid _num_ .
staff is the best !
their bread is amazing , though .
the only answer i got was prices are different after certain hours .
both are good and usually can feed 3-4 people if portioned properly .
service is good .
ho was great and really helped my wife and i thought a difficult time .
everyone is always so friendly and their sells are pretty good !
i recently went in to a wal-mart establishment in phoenix az store # _num_ .
it was corned beef on a roll .
and remember dont give up on your little girl she will come around !
do n't go back to baskin and robbins !
do n't go to this metro location .
the have good sports , great music and cheap beer !
there is another good thing about the restaurant ... the service .
just as good as any other olive garden .
it reminds me of home .
they are cheap .
why am i still surprised when companies are unethical and dishonest ?
i am happy to say that we did not have the same experience .
i am not a fan .
this is a oil change express station with two servicing stations .
we will not be back !
the dish was very bland .
she did agree to adding a order of fries free of charge .
this place is awful !
i love there food .
yeah !
sorry but extremely pissed at them and will never be back !
the whole drink area was a mess as was the dining area .
first off , this place is beyond crowded !
i have never felt so damn uncomfortable in my life !
do not trust these people with your card !
Neutral
everything is fresh too .
she just told me to pick something else .
member services ... is slow !
not the food but the service .
everything on the menu is something you can recommend to your friends .
the lady that did my pedi did not even put a top coat on .
the guys gave good diagnostic to my car !
place is amazing !
not her , and this location is going to pay for her mistake .
everything was excellent ; however , the egg rolls were primarily cabbage .
this is the worst excuse for italian food ever .
fast service , and great customer service !
$ _num_ for two _num_ oz steaks _num_ salad bar .
little dragon is a family owned restaurant and they are always nice .
service was quick , food was good and the prices are cheap .
however , this is a school .
you had the best old school video games ever .
total , almost $ _num_ !
super close to home and did such a great job .
no wonder the place was empty .
wth , potatoes or hash browns & eggs are what makes a breakfast burrito .
the manager said well i talk to her .
the sandwiches are great for eating in .
amazing little family owned place !
its so worth it .
upon entering , the atmosphere was just ok .
highly recommended .
this place has horrible customer service .
i love the wings but they are n't worth the beyond terrible service .
the past _num_ years they have really gone down hill .

every time i have been to wong 's i have had a great meal .
it is tolerable maybe once but not four times .
_num_ star there .
good beer selection .
this is excellent chinese food .
this place is horrible !
the cashier do n't understand you and the order was messed up .
he always knows the secrets .
my husband thought the carne asada was tender and flavorful .
lots of options , decent prices .
what a shame !
i 've had better from other greasy spoon diners and brunch places in california .
best wings in arizona .
returns are easy with or without receipts .
unfortunately for the price of rent here the apartments are really dated .
macayo 's has great food but a poor happy hour .
love it !
i was so stoked to find a place near me , with good reviews .
if i could i would give _num_ stars .
do n't stay here .
when is the last time you were here '' blah blah blah .
the owner and nail tech who attended me and did my pedicure were lovely !
i am not exaggerating .
this place is amazing !
but what was n't acceptable was the salt level in the food .
very good mexican food !
they do n't have my ink .
do not stop here if you are wanting fast service .
love the peanuts .
they were quick , affordable , and honest !
Positive
we left at 6am cutting our _num_ night start to one .
this place is worse than a prison !
my hubby and i frequent this waffle house , usually late at night .
even the manager i spoke to was n't up to par .
she did n't even realize that we already had our food .
the sight of the food was just completely unappealing .
there care is sub-par .
great service and good people who care about the community .
poor customer service .
best place for pizza on the west side in my opinion .
my fianc and i had an amazing dining experience .
wonderful comfort food .
not the best area , but worth the trip !
this is a step above what i was expecting .
as i said before , one pass .
price was fair .
the food was very good .
i did n't have to give you a dime .
i assure you , i have no problem paying my way .
not worth the money .
the food and service were outstanding !
so we changed it up and guess what pizza still sucks !
delicious soft served ice cream .
i will never come to this restaurant again .
the second room was better , but still nothing spectacular .
this was the worst one i 've ever been to !
i was very disappointed with my manicure .
the fiesta potatoes are never cooked all the way through .
this gem was recommend to my by a local at the game .
it is tacky to the touch and uneven .
they graciously walked my team through the installation process as well after the sell .
instead , they made everything so much hard and more painful .
love , love , love ... .
the owners are really nice and it is family run .
i will never set foot inside another macayo 's again .
this place was filthy !
food , i did n't like .
friendly and fast , this location is fast food done right .
highly recommended .
i 've always had good service here , and we are here often .
after slow service this morning i decided to look up this business on yelp .
they ca n't find my house .
the orange chicken , sesame chicken and fried rice are very good as well .
very professional and gracious staff , absolutely wonderful food .
a year later the transmission is still doing great !
i tell him `` sir , i 'm standing right here in line . ''
the service is super friendly and perfectly attentive while not being overbearing .

make him put his weights away !
my husband has had problems with this location too .
this was beyond unacceptable !
the food was great and our server , connie was amazing !
the employees were very helpful and polite , and i felt very welcome .
he received great care and was a completely different dog by that evening .
half the time they ca n't get my order right .
really good food in huge portions .
it 's one place in the valley where you can get decent chinese food !
they really need to get some workers in there that know how to cook .
the chicken alfredo was nasty .
we made the right choice !
this place is terrible !
if your in the neighborhood , definitely worth the stop .
no way .
the food is absolutely yummy .
it was worth the drive .
they have great specials and prices are very reasonable .
really a good word today .
nice to have a change taste in an area stuffed with mexican restaurants .
they have new pedicure chairs and the staff is always nice .
there are way better places than here so please look else where .
man this place used to be great .
disappointing meal .
this is not something the family should have to deal with !
great italian food - huge deli department .
great vw shop !
great experience !
the sweet and sour pork , taste like chicken nuggets !

so when i come to arizona it 's nice to get my quick fix .
also enjoyed their homemade ice cream in a waffle cone .
service here sucked .
the food is delicious and the staff is attentive to our needs .
very good food .
by far the best and only choice for healthy fast food in the area .
they lost touch and do n't know how to deal with the living !
according to aaa , the wrong size filter was installed .
he not only has fair prices he also stands behind his work .
are you freaking kidding me ?
it gets the job done .
or did you just quit caring ?
love it !
great bosnian food , excellent friendly service .
great wings !
grease with a side of food poisoning .
each lady was busy , but they assisted me right away .
i love their sauce , which is fairly sweet with good tomato notes .

the elevator button was missing for a bit on the third floor .
it 's the worst pizza i 've ever had .
the bathroom was disgusting .

windows have n't been cleaned in years you can see scum on them .
i ca n't see what other people see in this place .
do not get tamales with baja sauce ... it 's mush .
the pizza dough was good and the wings were big and fresh .

the quality and quantity of food is exceptional .

two thumbs down .
i would rather be dirty than stay one more min in this place .
they have the best chinese food in the valley , much better than pf .

if you are in the area i recommend you give them a try .
we had a large party at lunch and they were amazing !
gravy and side of corn were so salty it ruined the meal .
is n't that a little bit unethical ?
they have great sweet treats and their subs are awesome .
there was no chicken on the inside .
the pizza and the wings were n't all that good either .
i highly recomend !
other pizza places always put dips and napkins when you buy pizza from them .

this company is complete fraud .
but quite obnoxious if you are not into that type of thing .

it 's the tortilla ... the tortilla is just perfect .
pizza is excellent as well .

favorite mexican in town , best value too .
this is my favorite chinese food place in az .

go back and have bad service again and spend more $ ?
i love the staff !
wonderful bosnian food .
spoke to a person at their office and was told sorry !
the pizza is so good !
never again after that have i ate there .

i was very satisfied with everything this place has to offer .
great food and great service !
she spoke english when she took my money .
it 's hard to express exactly how much i love the arizona humane society .
maybe that 's why the inside of the restaurant was so dead .
she ended up with a mild first degree burn on her stomach .
heaven .
horrible !
i have adopted one dog and one cat from here .
overall , it 's a typical chinese american restaurant .
no one is behind me not no line .
they have never changed any items over the years and it always tastes amazing !
this was after i paid them to fix my pool .
they treat you like family .
i do n't know what happened but the crust is not the same .
i hate them for not giving me the option by calling me first .

poor ambience and operations .
a little over an hour wasted sitting waiting ... absolutely horrible customer service .

awful , food sits and is old .
best hot wings !
egg drop soup & spring rolls are excellent .
thanks for you great service tony !
i only go since it is on the way home from work .
the selection was similar to sweet tomatoes , but lower quality .

gross gross gross !
he was very unhelpful and rude .
absolutely fantastic food .
they get my order wrong .
service - sketchy ... um appetizers are served before the entree not after .
burns in the blankets and little dead bugs on top of bed !

extremely long wait time .
they make the best `` house fried rice '' that i know of .
it was very busy .
the staff are very friendly and helpful .
this is the best barber shop in phoenix .
plus he was n't very helpful with putting my car in the driveway .
diner beware : it will go down under quickly .

no toppings , just soft serve vanilla ice cream .
this restaurant is just amazing .
based on my last experience i do n't think i will bring my car back.
sweet and sour pork is my favorite .
place is in desperate need of some renovation .
we stopped by the drive thru sunday morning to pick up two breakfast burritos .

i really appreciate it .
it was my first time riding horse and i loved every moment of it .

customer service _num_ : never argue with a customer !
big mistake .
worst hotel experience ever .

i must same the service we received today was excellent .
while the food itself seems to taste okay .
serves bad and slow .
she was too confused to answer my question .
this was my first visit here and i was impressed .
unfortunately i will not be eating here again ... .
big mistake .
steak and ribs outstanding .
the crust was plain and there was a lot of it .
i also really enjoy the won ton soup and combo fried rice .
great alternative to buffet chinese .
the wings are great too !
a year later it fried again .
is their clientele so vast that they can afford to treat people like crap ?
nothing to write home about , but i 'll write it on yelp .
worst service ever .
it was a little rude and off putting .
but she made it that much better !
i built my pie online and set up a carryout option with cash payment .
this place has authentic mexican food , the chicken tacos are great !
_num_ am and no place to sleep .
very nice server 's .
i ca n't do this place & will never recommend it to anyone .
he gave me my money back .

my husband and i went to dq and we went through the drive through .
pretty open yet challenging .

they make their own tortillas right in front of you .
thanks central !
these donuts have the perfect texture and taste .
bad service .
it does help out with you have children .
so i did but still not satisfied .
sure would like to know why ?
no apologies , nothing .
they are very cautious about safety and paired us up with great horses .
both looked grossed as hell .
the neighborhood is bad and it reflects in their attitude toward their customers .
always a good thing .
they really need a waitress to run the floor .
service was great , friendly , and they were very attentive .
i did n't want to drink out of my glass .
harkins definitely has the best theaters in phoenix .
terrible service .

i said i only use apple .
they charged for unnecessary supplies for a very poor quality service .
they are great treated her so kind and good .
and the coffee there is good too .
when i took my first bite i was brought back to so many memories .
this establishment has always stayed consistent with their food as far as taste .
i love the people they are always so nice !
they maintain consistency and you can always expect an excellent meal .
i do n't recommend going there .
the food is lacking quality and cost is not that great .
overall value is really good , and it satisfied me for lunch .
it 's that good !
not very tasty , not authentic sopapillas .
now i want to give it a zero .
happy workers !
damn it was freezing !
the food is very authentic and fresh .

my endless pasta bowl was disgusting , i do n't know a better term .
also , a free tow to the company .
the bread was amazing and the turkish coffee was out of this world .
disgusting !
the crust on a frozen pizza was better than the crust on this one .
this place is crap .
all the sides were wrong .
its great service and great steaks .
great food great prizes .
assuming that they had it on file , i didnt even ask .
they look great tho .
so he proceeded to hand me my order and then asked for the money .
amazing if you ask me .
she tries to upsell me on the meal , i say no .
no drink order .
it was n't terrible , but it was n't pleasant .
i will be back !
the crew and office staff were so nice !

first impression when i walk into the place is the smell of dirty carpets .
zero customers , food took forever .
yelp is my review , my story , and my life .
just try it and fall in love !
had the worst experience at the deli section .
the sandwich was greasy and tasted like chemicals .
they do n't have a separate person working the drive through window .
still my favorite place to get a green chili burger !
so gross today .
this place when using their coupon is an amazing value .
we tried the sausage and cabbage rolls and both were very good .
very very disappointing .

the food was amazing and the culture was better .
great place for family dining .
i saw them put _num_ small containers front of me and said no .
definitely my new favorite authentic taco shop !

great family environment , and the staff is always friendly and attentive .
thanks , motel _num_ for leaving the light on .

there were no check-out lanes open .
this facility is really amazing .
however always check your order !

been coming here for years it is definitely to go to comida china .
it makes me never want to buy furniture again .
service was alright but the food was terrible .
i would recommend not going to this place ever !
nice small atmosphere that brings out the bosnian culture .
i was very unimpressed with this store .
made an appointment to get my oil changed at 8am on june 2nd .
save your money and do n't buy a warranty !
excellent chinese food !
luckily i had cash so i paid her for exactly what i had ordered .
my salad was meh and my fianc 's ribs were a little dry .
walked out of this place after _num_ min of no service .
the third order our garlic knots were burnt and hard .
excellent service all around and for a great price !

this hotel sucks .
_num_ % pure comfort food that reminds me of home .
there was no sign or anything to say i could n't park there .

the service was fantastic .
maintenance replaced the phone .
the equipment they had was really outdated and painful .
gross .
this hotel was the worst hotel we stayed in .
it was a empty bar .
$ _num_ wasted on this place .
we drove _num_ minutes across town to adopt a kitten .
he could n't breath .
brought my son in for care .
the pastas , hot or cold are great as well .
everything we looked at was in pretty good condition .
was a great evening !
dine in is classy and sophisticated .
i am also happy they are taking credit cards now now .
* the office manager anna is insanely rude .
our waitress was so southern and charming .
even with my custom orders everything is always perfect .
so they leave you with a terrible experience every , single , time .
ok , all done with red lobster for a good long while now .
i love mexican food and was craving rolled tacos with guacamole and chicken chimichanga .
thank you to tony and the staff for the exceptional service we got .
really love this place .
this is the best drunk food drunk money can buy .
i have been a loyal big o customer for many years .
but there came a point that i could ignore no more .
the lady that runs this place is awesome - extremely friendly .
great music playing on the radio .
not cuz of the hair but because of the mediocre food .
i went to red lobster today with my family the service was horrible .
the orange chicken was barely warm .
pumps and bathrooms are always dirty .
i ca n't wait to get rid of sprint because of this !
she was amazing !
i will always use this company in the future .
good food and great to go service .

also i checked out the restroom .
my favorite safeway to shop at !
an hour was just right for our first ride .
they 're food is always freshly cooked and cooked well .
great store !
it 's the best i 've had and it 's relatively cheap !
nobody called me .
but i am not sure about the frozen lunch meat you are offered .
bad business decision , in my opinion .
get something to go or stay for awhile , your mouth will thank you .
does n't offer and soy sauce or anything else .
no child or baby here .
i 've had nothing but bad experiences with then .
hits the spot if you are a real carnivore .
their service is also very good .
this food is so delicious .
_num_ for the homeless .
whose **** do i need to suck to get a drink around here ?
i 'll definitely go back !
i 'm fat enough .
the staff are very friendly and happy to explain the different dishes .
night was ruined before i got my food .
not joking _num_ freakin minutes i was in there and i was gone .
wo n't return and threw away 3/4 of the pizza .
we both love it !
by far the worst dining experience i 've ever had in my entire life .
the chicken egg foo young was ok .
the non-smoking room reeked , but that was n't even the start .
this is good food and i would recommend it to anyone !
the beer is still cold and good .
it is an excellent place with a great atmosphere .
all in all , a very good lunch .
surprisingly we did n't wait too long until our party of _num_ was seated .
affordable german auto is great .
i gave my friend money to purchase me food for lunch .
good portions super cheap and food is pretty good !
best food is the fried rice .
we will definitely visit this location again .
the only thing different is that they refilled the paper towel dispenser .
he was always reassuring me while in the chair .
the potatoes were cold and so was the macaroni and cheese .
they need table cloths , spotless glasses , uniforms , and managing .
they always know what the right wines to recommend for me .
the arizona humane society 's campus for compassion is a fantastic animal shelter .
then an hour goes by no food .
service was good , food was pretty good , price was reasonable .
she loves the orange and strawberry and her mom loves the mocha .
worst customer service ever !
both were amazing .
yes , hoping someone would hear me .
we stay at motel _num_ a lot , but this is the worst .
he sure as hell didnt .
i used to love the mussels appetizer , but this visit they were awful .
round tables make seating a large group a bit strange but love the place .
getting by bed delivered was a pain .
was told it 's a _num_ minute wait .
we get back home and the order was wrong .
also , most of the machines are taken all the time .
absolute no seasoning on the nasty meat .
what i was not fine with .
some of the language was suspect , but other than that it was great !
horrible customer service and very rude front desk lady .
our server was really really rude .
to add to that , they are super slow !
their cookies are tasty too .
so we she did get to see him but almost by force .
they do an awesome job at an affordable price .
i liked the food and service .
horrible service and ethics !
the service here sucks .
good deal and delicious pizza .
it was hot but i noticed immediately , no pizza aroma !
love their seafood soup .
this place is horrible , ca n't even finish my lunch .
absolutely the best .
thanks so much again !
best taco i 've ever had .
amazing service and food !
i ordered them with no guacamole , add extra cheese .
i literally could n't believe what had happened .
but didnt think it meant getting a _num_ % cooked pizza .
i love the food it 's always the same great taste .
it is their best dish !
i will definitely return with my volkswagen for future service and repair .
okay !
overall , i was not impressed and regret going .
as writing this still stuck in the drive thru .
stay away from this unprofessional establishment .
terrible experience do n't recommend to anybody .
the meat is dark , fatty , and does n't even taste like chicken .
what a hidden gem !
the point of having a _num_ hour location is for convenience .
my kids love their pizza .
this is a great and blessed church of god !
mediocre quality , at best .
i had it transferred to another location and got my meds in _num_ mins .
breakfast was good enough .
do n't bother to remember this place .
its not some fancy restaurant , but its the best .
great ... .
worth a look if you are in the area .
unfortunately , i am unable to say the same about my experience here today .
the selection was better but probably because it 's a ghost town at metro .
could hardly find the mozzarella either .
i had to tell one of the managers but they did n't care .
they just out some on top .
how absurd !
this means for over a month i will have no refrigerator .
but the food is great , the prices are decent too .
hopefully they will open up somewhere else , when their lease is up .
service was great too !
i visit phoenix quite a bit and i always have to eat here .
disgusting .
drinks were filled promptly without being asked , and our server was very friendly .
highly recommended !
the decor was a lot nicer than i was expecting too .
no pay at pump .
one time i came in on a friday and only one teller was working .
place is decent sized not too packed and always clean .
cheap drink specials .
disappointing .
wifi worked just fine .
i wish i would have gone with them !
best moo shu pork in phoenix !
price is very reasonable , you get a lot of food .
the turkish coffee is very strong and great when paired with dessert .
outside smells _num_ times better than my room did .
their customer service via phone or in person is excellent .
do not go here .
daniel was very honest and upfront with all costs and expectations !
that is ridiculous !
the waitress just left the mess she made for is to clean up .
they also a lot of fresh seafood in live tanks .
good food at a decent price .
so i asked again for the manager and explained the situation .
will come back next time we come into town .
i told the lady that it was hurting and she did n't stop .
do n't waste your money here .
the prices are pretty cheap and the food is flavorful and traditional .
so my wings came out _num_ mins before pizza was done .
awesome happy hour too !
stay away from here as i will !
how else can one explain the _num_ and _num_ stars for this place ?
we walked in and the place was dirty and not well lit .
if i could rate them _num_ i would .
i took one bite and could n't eat anymore .
sadly , it took another five mins for our food to arrive , incorrectly .
our food was fantastic !
club west is one of my favorites in the valley .
do n't buy the groupon .
the food has never been much more than convenient .
it takes many appointments , and takes longer then _num_ minutes to do !
the gel nail polish i got was perfect !
they need a serious remodeling and to clean this mess up .
all in all ... we will not be coming back .
looked at the bottom of container barely any sauce .
be polite on the phone , then hang up and talk crap about them .
first off the happy hour deals are pretty good .
it is still one of the best chinese restaurants in the valley .

my appetizer was cold , half of the bowl of muscles were closed .
i love how close this texas roadhouse is to my house !
they are very friendly and meticulous .

great payment options , a solution for every customer .
i love this place and will definitely make it a regular spot !
very rude girls working here !
they have quality freshly made food for low prices !
great customer service !
i ordered the teriyaki chicken and it was a little bland .
they are consistently rude and unprofessional .
fed up i called the district manager .
the door would not open .
it 's for sure the next best thing to making it yourself .
unfortunately eating some taco bell would be a better choice .
great service , good food- even without a coupon , we 'd go back .
not much of the egg was noticeable in either dish .
the food is delicious , fresh , and obviously authentic .
they seem to sincerely care about my cat .
eat here occasionally , good food choices for everyone .
i absolutely love this place !
had no idea it was spring training and alot of places were booked .
would definitely recommend .
but as for my experience , this place has been really good to us .

wonderful place .
any chain restaurant , for that matter , has better pizza .
lots of shady people out and about .
Negative
great store and nice customer service .
i asked them to make me a custom veggie burro and it was wonderful .
i got one $ _num_ credit but it did n't continue .
possibly the best tortas in the west valley .
great prices !
the food is very good and the service is very nice .
needless to say we were shocked .
it tastes bland .
we felt so comfortable with this shop and thats hard to come by .
the customer service is none the girls and the cook are rude .
the server nikki was awful , the food was mediocre at best .
i love this place .
the food here is amazing !
the burritos are huge and can be easily shared by two people .
after moving from california i definitely needed a great donut shop !
the delivery was fast and the pizza was perfect !
this particular location has excellent customer service .
good price .
i got sucked in .
this place is definitely worth driving to and will be an annual vacation favorite .
the meat was soft and tender with good flavor .
we 'll definitely be back .
that 's too bad cause this is the closest sears to my house .
yes it 's located in the `` ghetto '' , but it 's delicious .
we literally could n't eat our dinner .
i recommend them to anyone .
they suck , after years of going there i am done .
the portion size is amazing .
the tiramisu and cannoli 's are perfect .
it is the stuff of nightmares .
at least this _num_ minute wait wont end badly .
if your looking for authentic chinese food , this is the place !
i visited macayo 's with a friend last night before a concert .
i was told because the neighborhood is bad .
he was extremely rude , and he hung up on me !
my uncle died very suddenly and unexpectedly .
cons : the first room they put me in stunk of cat urine !
the next room was not under construction but clearly needed repairs .
the carrot and celery sticks are mushy and off color .
the honey sesame chicken was cold .
ask for fried rice with your meal they give you chicken fried rice .
i always have fresh warm sweet & sour with spring rolls .
and it was really tasty !
the stink when i opened the door to my room was really awful .
all of these are tasty .
the amount of business alone should make it worth your while .
the waitress then offered to refill our bread basket .
unfortunately we had o option then to stay there .
the guy in front of us was ordering in spanish .
will continue shopping here !
the service was friendly and the food was n't very expensive .
best service ever !
they were naturally cold so we asked for something a little fresher .
motorcycle !
highly recommended .
if you ask after they give you your bag they get all mad .
he 's great , energetic , and makes sure our food is perfect .
loved it .
shame .
the chairs are comfortable and the prices are affordable .
baklava is the best you 'll ever have , hands down .
nothing was ever mentioned about smoking rooms .
carlos and anthony are really professional .
every time i drive by the store i 'm reminded of the horrible experience .
i 'm pissed because good customer service would have been .
i spent almost _num_ min laughing at just _num_ jacket .
they were quite disgusting .
waited _num_ minutes at the service desk .
could n't check the second room since our key did n't work .
bomb wings but slow service .
but , all _num_ wings were bad .
bad bed very poor sleep .
i will eat there again .
now i remember why i do n't like olive garden .
i sent my boyfriend within ten mins to go pick our dinner up .
keep up the good work .
good eating !
to make matters worse , the place has all the atmosphere of a warehouse .
so much better than subway .
i asked for _num_ queen beds and got _num_ double beds .
i ca n't help but understand why sears is in such financial trouble .
so in conclusion , this store ... do n't , just ... do n't .
this place is the worst place i have ever been too .
the food portions are huge for a great price .
you can keep your rotten tomatoes and sour salsa , jerks .
the customer service that i experienced here was on par with any other salon .
he does not know how to operate the business .
the wait was reasonable , especially for brunch on a sunday .
then i get up to the register .
definitely worth a visit if you 're in the area !
this is the best food i have had since arriving in phoenix .
you name it they got it .
when you pay for your order her proceeds to walk away after your change .

the staff at this location was amazing .
it just would n't be worthwhile .
called early this morning at 8am to schedule an appointment for an oil change .
the service has improved tremendously .
she was attentive , prompt and friendly .
this one is trashy !
the pepper steak is another good one .
then they did not have the part and rescheduled for the next week !
_num_ % tip from your bill is more then enough if you ask me .
of my entree , only the salad was great !
she did n't file my nails nor even clean them out .
the staff is always friendly .
my torta was n't too big but but was very filling .
his front office staff are all friendly and accommodating .
when i arrived to pick it up they did n't have it .
best place in town for a great burger and fries !
i had an absolutely great ceviche and some bomb ass oysters !
just got a dog from the campus for compassion , what an incredible facility .
i recommend this organization to everyone i know .
the lo mein is amazing as are the cream puffs .
i 'm disappointed to say i 'll be avoiding this one for now on .
i love this location !
i personally like the pork or combo fried rice the best .
i like mine with extra sauce .
a month later , i still had not received my dryer back .
will be eating here a lot !
the employees at this service station truly care about there customers .
after this experience , we 're not sure if we want to return .
i hate it .
guess it 's not my thing .
however i am not satisfied with this place .
the servers are very friendly and will always try to make you laugh .
they did n't bother me .
the prices are astounding .
went to get my dogs nails trimmed and bath .
they have a ton of clothing and a pretty decent furniture section .
overall a bad experience for _num_ bucks !
finally the food comes , and of course , the order is wrong .
if i could rate it _num_ stars , i would .
the food for the most part is quite good .
i will definitely be back .
this is one of my family 's favorite establishments .
so cute .
great service , even better food .
looking for a new breakfast spot and this is it !
as well as the other employees there .
the food is always great !
poor service .
the other constant is how rude everyone is .
not to mention that is not even busy !
the staff is very helpful and answers all of my questions without being condescending .
i will not come back .
this place did not and i was unable to finish my $ _num_ cocktail .
very sad .
but domino 's is at least on par with pizza hut and papa johns .
the gentleman behind the counter was very friendly and helpful .
very highly recommended !
poor customer service .
this place is awesome .
there are _num_ sinks but only _num_ mirror in there too .
awesome staff .
i did n't believe them like i stated above .
after he had just patiently stood there waiting for her for over _num_ minutes .

the sides were terrible .
disappointed !
basic good food for breakfast .
love the design and how manicured the grounds are maintained .
i told him that is not my issue .
i washed my hands _num_ times that night .
they make a solid michelada too .
i do n't even think we 'll bother going back there .
i would give this place negative stars if i could .
i do n't know what happened but the mongolian bbq no longer exists .
first time here and the service was very good .
not even worth to try .
and the service is also great every time i come here .
they have several really great salsas .
my husband thought the soup was good and the egg roll was crispy .
the ice cream ( yogurt ) machine is no more .
we leave and walk the mall .
my favorite theaters !
the menu has nothing healthy on it .
the service is always great and the people are quite nice .
normally a person will tip _num_ % - _num_ % of their bill .
drink sizes are nice and big .
do n't eat at this place .
so excited to have a chinese place near my office !
the pizza is incredible and a large is less than $ _num_ .
no problem with the actual care at the facility .
incredibly rude .
service and food was amazing .
do n't waste your money here if you are looking for a meal .
can never get things fixed .
otherwise great food !
got helped out by francisco and he was very friendly and efficient .
we will definitely be back !
not a good experience maybe a bad night for them ?
the hot wings are outstanding .
the food was awful .
the service was nice but not worth coming back .

kind of pricy but worth it .
foods delicious and very affordable .
it was a horrible experience .

dennis offers the best diamonds , excellent design recommendations , and top workmanship .
would recommend to anyone .
i will definitely be going back .
i would highly recommend ya 'll to check this place out !
my partner thought it too sour .
this is by far the worst nail salon i have been too .
our server christina was very attentive and on top of things .
she recommended the steak with the cheese and pepper , great choice !
this was perfect .
the rest are worthless , unreliable , and extremely rude and unprofessional !
the scenery was great , well worth the money .
the waitress ( mothers granddaughter ) is sweet and gives solid service .
this place has awesome sea food my favorite are the breaded shrimp .
this gym i way over do for an upgrade .

it was the same if not worse .
uber friendly staff , great value for steaks and quick service .
it 's super easy to order , fast and convenient .
honestly this is one of the worst food dining experiences i have ever had .
now it is just plain bad food .
at the very best it should have been under $ _num_ for it all .
very friendly people !
they do n't take care of their comics .
very very good american chinese food .
tried complaining to corporate office and they turned me back to the manager .
it was our first time at red lobster , and probably our last .
the very nice lady behind the counter said sure no problem .
someone did n't clean the place thoroughly .
i am not a fan of milk , but love this milk .
old appliances , like really old !
i had never been to a texas roadhouse quite like this one .
first , the cashier clearly did n't want to be there .
she started yelling and giving me bad attitude .
_num_ .
poor service .
my dough was mushy , crust was soft and had no crisp to it .
it did n't taste horrible , just cheap ... so only a minor fail .
kid friendly as well .
but nothing show stopping .
he enjoyed it very much !
mothers has been a great place forever .
good taste !
i ended up waiting almost _num_ mins which was inconvenient .
the food is always great and a fair price .

kids were delighted .
i would have been better off at kfc .
what an awesome experience !
like money was brought up a lot .
it 's our family 's favorite pizza !
i did n't care for the food , thought it was bland .
a nice clean restaurant .
they put some hard work in keeping quite nice .
no eggs no green olives ect and paid almost ten dollars !
we ordered ribeye and shrimp and both were wonderful .
she was amazing !
it fell short of the layered , fried chicken crust this dish should have .
this store has a great staff !
the place was crowded on monday morning ( labor day ) .
this does n't even come close .
the service is terrible .
the enchiladas were the real disappointment .
i am never going to this one again .
asked for sausage egg cheese biscuit with bacon instead of sausage .
yuck , yuck yuck .
we found _num_ in a corner , the rest was n't cleaned .
great deal at only $ _num_ !
it is wonderful !
best pediatrician in town !
not by a long shot !
we were delighted with our choice .
that was bad sign # _num_ .
the movie detail sucks .
regardless of which location we go to we get the same excellent service !
so do they ; why are you asking ?
he was extremely knowledgeable and patient with me .
making me sick just thinking about it .
the water was barely flowing .
the staff is courteous and friendly and the morning coffee is good .
sure , puppies are cute for a few months , but they need training .
again in a super loud voice we were told no .
i would normally give og a 3-4 .
shame on you texas roadhouse .
good pizza & friendly staff .
definitely coming back if service stays at this level .
great pizza much like the east coast pizza shops .
this is a great company to work with .
the meat is always very fresh .
the food is excellent and plentiful .
this on the other hand was a disaster from the beginning .
the service is very polite and attentive .
shady area , even a security guard is walking the grounds .
the waiting time is just ridiculous .
it took them two days to come out and fix my fridge .
these guys do a great job for $ _num_ .
i ca n't do that .
consistent & efficient .
i wish i could give this place negative stars .
the chips are unremarkable .
i always order it when i go there and it is always awesome .
i was told that i would have to wait over a week for repair .
their pineapple was bad .
thanks eddie and party city .
mango margarita was pretty bad .
extremely happy with this place !
zero stars just the middle finger .
terrible customer service , staff arguing with each other .
i do n't know , though , just my opinion .
two other customers had incorrect orders at the same time too .
these donuts have the perfect texture and taste .
this guy is awesome !
( which the soda was flat ) .
i have never had such terrible service , especially from management as well .
i really like this snack truck .
i 've stayed at other super _num_ before and it was n't like this .
you should do your best to avoid this wal-mart .
she immediately got an attitude and told me they was not cold .
no touching , no going ahead of people , no laughter , no dancing .
lots of issues with the games not working and not giving tickets out .
i absolutely love love love their popcorn !
i do n't know how else to put it .
customer service sucks .
absolutely the right place when you want to have a dinner with your family .
pros : they 've got a really good selection .
fresh made bread for the tortas and refreshing fruit drinks !
she then blamed me !
we opened the door to the room , it smelled .
do not order from here they are the worst !
wrong !
first off , their lay out is all over the place .
_num_ .
ingredients were of low quality with no taste .
the staff was friendly and always came by to check if everything was good .
the service is excellent and food was superb .
it took maybe _num_ minutes .
)
good service .
avoid this location at all cost !
very consistent over the years !
floor and ceiling look like they have been rode hard and hung up wet .
i highly recommend that you never go here unless you want to get frustrated .
very dangerous area it is infested with scorpions .
this doctor was horrible .
by far one of the worst shopping experiences i 've ever had .
so i was immediately done with this place .
specially the house fried rice !
the restrooms did n't work , toilet paper everywhere .
good service .
everything was so very salty .
we still had to wait longer than our scheduled pick up time .
it was n't any better .
wo n't be back for quite awhile .
i called the salon before purchasing the groupon to check their availability .
i was disappointed that our pizza did n't have that this time .
so so good ... the food is of great quality and prices are reasonable .
however i have two main complaints that result in such a low rating .
we had the most amazing dining experience here all because of our server andy !
their customer service is excellent !
you 're not going to find any of that useful shit at party city .
pretty sad , really .
the `` sour '' is n't in the name to make it sound pretty .
under it 's current management it 's a complete ripoff .
more importantly , the food sucked .
order was wrong .
the mongolian beef was amazing , orange chicken tasty and crunchy .
they also have wise potato chips and italian ice .
his customers service skills are poor at best .
the cabbage rolls were very tasty and flavorful .
also , the noodles were halfway over cooked .
last week we had the best calzone since we moved here to az .
i have always received excellent service at this denny 's .
they do n't add much to the meal .
gross !
the horses were great .
no more service from me .
this was a waste of time .
the chicken was sliced , grilled , and tasted like it was microwaved .
great diner food , great diner service , great diner prices .
right now , _num_ '' cold cut or meatball subs are _num_ .
any other store , one could request a price check .
it always feels crowded .
otherwise , this place is a joy and the food is so good !
brothers specializes in new york style pizza .
so , this place was perfect to just sleep and go .
food and service were both great .
the service was great and the food has never disappointed .
they did , and the pastries were delicious .
especially kayla in grooming !
i got done what i needed to get done .
will continue to go here for my chickens needs .
it 's so clean , so bright , so happy !
it 's always clean , the food looks fresh and tastes great every time .
finally they said it 'll be ready in _num_ mins .
like i said , i did my homework .
the house fried rice and egg rolls are the best in phoenix .
it takes a lot of skill to help people smoothly during a difficult time .
said she 'd be back with it , never returned with one .
which i expected , i have been to corporate vets before .
he fully explained my new family plan and how to use my iphone .
neither of them acknowledged me .
phoenix hidden gem !
i do n't recommend .
let alone the store manager was snotty and rude !
i totally agree but the way he said it was very arrogant .
do n't waste your time or money here .
service , adequate ; food , tasty .
Positive
awesome !
which is also a place i would not want to ever go back to .
we had a great conversation and a few laughs .
i 'm pretty sure you 'll walk out of there sick !
half the lights do n't work .
great value and super good food .
its so much better than the other chinese food places in the west valley .
i did n't have tub , just a shower with a seat .
serve it with a limp iceberg and a bland dressing , that 's how .
i once tried the spicy beef with mushrooms ... delicious .
the course conditions very nice especially with the new greens and tee boxes .

no way .
_num_ .
the wheat bread was not very good , and too thick .

why are the fast food chains always so busy ?
also the oyster beef is very good .
the sandwich artist 's were very nice .

a little more professionalism and significantly more customer appreciation is needed at this company .
_num_ .
the food is basically the same , with some new items to me .
not satisfied at all .
even when they about and should be trying to get rid of their food .
the hot n sour soup was okay .
this is a place that i frequent for pizza .

the price of the sandwiches are very reasonable .
no paper towels anywhere in gas fill up area .
thanks _num_ star for that .
_num_ stars .

good food speaks for itself and i respect that !
i recently moved in the area and was looking for a good sub shop .

the guacamole tasted watery and bland .
the food was great but andy made our night perfect !
worth checking out if you are on that side of town .
avoid this place .

they have a lunch special and larger specials that can feed a family .
the whole company employees and all where very nice and effective .
no food ready but asked if i could pay now .
so much food , we had to take it home .
needless to say we spent too much money for a not very satisfying meal .
dr b is an amazing dr .

i think that 's totally awesome .
_num_ .
no patience at all !
he was so professional and nice and i felt completely comfortable with his adjustment .
so worth it !
our move was a nightmare was the start .
walk up menu and salsa bar for lunch only .
we 've tried all their main entres & they are all delightful .
love it here !
i 'm only giving one star because i ca n't give zero .
quality and quantity is given here .
all was well prepared and served .
the food is consistent .
needs a new transmission , they say `` as is '' i get it .
place is very clean and prices are very inexpensive !
liked it .
no apology .
the pizza here was good .
i will definitely come back for that and the singapore noodles .

the worst !
but i can try to texture it . ''
i just love this place !
you really ca n't go wrong with fried shrimp .
the sandwiches were not good at all .
a must try and a new favorite .
i , and my friends will avoid that course for now .
that was definitely a nice touch .
that should have been washed properly , someone could get sick .
a great place for brunch and quite inexpensive too !
the staff at this location are phenomenal .
perhaps not the best place to eat in doors but good take out food .
friendly service .
i love this place .
the seating sucks .
they were very careful and gentle .
asked for fried rice and honey sesame chicken .
everyone i know says it 's great too , so it 's that good .
that is n't cool .
this is my favorite chinese place to go so far .
no green grass at all .
she would have ignored me completely had i not called for her attention .
awesome service !
i just had the best lunch ... as always the food is consistently great !
very nice place to eat !
i totally recommend her .
our group of four had a great ride with our guide , travis .
excellent quality .
i have recommended him to many of my friends over the years .
i took my sierra pickup to these guys and they did a fantastic job .
no flavor .
again , the pizza is outta this world .
after they hook you , they do n't care .
it 's very loud , unclean and humans there buy everything .
i get the best service and friendly attitudes when i visit in the morning .
crappy customer service .
this is seriously the best subway i have ever been to .
horrible customer service .
wings always made to my liking and very crispy .
goodbye macayo 's , you will be missed .
what a great place !
the staff is really friendly .
last i checked _num_ minutes was _num_ hour and _num_ minutes .
both times the bartender was too busy to take my dinner order .
go here and leave happy .
and left , never to return .
they were a soggy , greasy , tasteless mess .
i would keep going to this place for that great service !
however , i 'm not paying for any of those things .
the flavor was wonderful in my coffee .
he is an amazing dentist .
i will not be coming back to this one .
this gym is always dirty , and equipment is either broken or outdated .
our waitress was very nice , personable , and checked on us often !
if i only had know i would never moved in .
so frustrating .
the wings sucked .
all in all the service and food was great !
it has such a homey taste and fulfilling .
very limited choices in regards to meat , vegetables , and sauces .
you 'll see the hands down difference this man can make in your life .
the only thing worse than the room was the staff .
i agree with jason b , the service here sucks !
worse service ever .
owners speak little to no english .
we loved the food and service !
awesome service !
i love going to places where the service is great !
one of the worst animal hospitals i have ever been too !
this one in particular is always nice to go into .
the service the last time i went was just terrible .
very pleasant service .
_num_ + 's from us !
the cashier was very friendly .
good self service area and great automatic area .
( this was done a week previous to this . )
this sonic is good .
i specially asked for a non smoking room but our room smells of smoke .
i have to say , i find the meat to be super sketchy .
the food was cold and did not meet expectations .
everything is delicious from the soup to the pitas !
but she said unfortunately they had no more sauce ?
i gave _num_ star for the side dishes .
love the floor plans and all the space even for a one bedroom !
that 's too bad .
they have the best egg cook i 've ever seen .
do not move here !
it 's not gourmet but it 's great eats at unbeatable prices .
the salad bar was full , rotated , hot , & delicious .
unfortunately my last experience on friday was horrible !
overall good .
so , his arrival did n't help the problem .
let me be specific as to why i do n't like this place .
the price point is good and great portions for the price .
and we 've tried a few different recipes , all of them amazing .
the staff was friendly and really knew how to engage the children in conversation .
there 's no chance i will ever be back .
i sat down and waited .
i generally like olive garden but this location is the worst .
the food is always fresh and well prepared .
please do step inside .
also have good specials and great customer service .
very excited to finally wear my watch .
pretty fast service.
employees are great would definitely come back to this location next time .
daniel and the staff are always friendly .
absolute worst experience .
a long drive , but worth it everytime .
so far so good .
service was prompt , courteous , and fast .
we could n't tell who worked there and who did n't .
then i waited another _num_ for a cappuccino that was cold when ordered hot .
it seemed gross and chewy .
no `` here you go ! ''
this seems to be a trend among courses that i do n't like .
do not spend your hard earned money at this location .
you wo n't get good sleep due to being worried about your vehicle .
the most awful place to move to !
disgusting .
love it !
- great prices .
one of my favorite is the powdered donuts with blueberry filling !
very generous portion and great taste .
the warm rolls with the cinnamon butter was also a treat !
maybe it was a bad day , but .
no , of course not !
the costumer service was excellent and the food was pretty good and good price !
that is to say , service was totally non-existent .
the hotel staff could n't have cared about anyone one .
he is gentle , takes his time , and makes you feel comfortable .
best place for eyebrows !
definitely recommend this location .
office max has officially lost my business .
friendly ladies working here too .
he was very nice and apologized for my experience .
i am absolutely disgusted with this store .
the food is fantastic and the prices are more than reasonable .
they always mess up my order and give me the wrong food .
never had eggs cooked so perfectly before .
that being said , the eggrolls were crunchy and the cabbage tasted good .
the staff is extremely rude and unorganized !
if i could give them a zero i would .
i gave them a call and never answered .
so of course i am going to use the vet visit .
i 'm not sure the food was old or it 's a food poisoning .
best egg drop i have ever had .
why are they taking over all the airports , stations , and rest stops ?
i will order from here again the price was right .
and the cashier was a complete bitch .
other than that i do n't know who else could appreciate this place .
they are charging _num_ a bottle .
the egg roll , over cooked , greasy , stale and horrible !
stick to the wings and you 'll be okay .
the taco was crispy and flavorful .
the round took _num_ 3/4 hours !
why would n't she tell me that from the beginning ?
score !
i love it and i know you will too .
how rude !
filthy restrooms with no paper towels .
i was good to go in less than an hour .
these people were excellent .
first , the driver was super late to pick up our stuff .
food was quick and delicious .
the front door was broken off of the cabinet that held the fridge .
that tells me you are not paying attention to what you are doing .
they do n't live up to their name .
lousy service .
i tried a side of cole slaw and it seemed very processed .
i can excuse the mess because i know how inconsiderate customers can be .
slow slow slow !
delicious .
bill is so cute and sweet , kind and an amazing artist .
i 'm very happy !
great pizza !
thanks !
this food is on par with both pei wei and p.f .
really over an hour behind and nothing .
everyone there is nice .
love it !
perfect for spring training also had lots of fun .
the lady who takes your order is rude .
i love the warm syrup and everything is cooked fresh .
excellent food and wonderful service .
unhappy and unsatisfied .
trying to get in and out is a constant challenge .
this is ridiculous !
my son 's smothered steak was da bomb !
definitely the best italian market in phoenix !
there was an employee drinking beer while he was working .
the food was disgusting .
and they are always tasty .
i requested a tow to coach works on a tuesday after hours .
their service is terrible !
not recommended just go to walmart or somewhere else .
7:30 am , i am told i will have to wait till _num_ am .
definitely worth it .
i am glad we only stayed one night here .
definitely worth checking out especially after drinking all night ... really hits the spot .
also missing , fork , napkins , condiments and the traditional fortune cookie .
great food !
she brought me my drink , minus the straw .
we will be searching for another vet and not coming back to this location .
this place is amazing .
clean and friendly .

but i just take it home and use my own !
sat down to eat .
great customer service and prices .
will be ordering again in the future !
then she asks me what entree .
their restaurant at this location was extremely clean .
real food , great value .
the lady that does my eyebrows does an amazing job !
i was there just as long as if i had ordered in the store .
the assistant manager jose is great as well .
it has been very educational and insightful .
the water tastes like it from the river and the food is excellent .
i ca n't believe that i just paid $ _num_ for her groom .
i was charged for the cheese too because the total was $ _num_ something .
even my brother did n't want to finish them .
it is a perfect place to get the short game on track .
the service was poor and the atmosphere did n't feel clean .
i show up a few minutes late and still wait an additional 10-15 minutes .
the bread wasnt too bad .
i have already called like _num_ times .
i 'll be a happy customer for life !
can never get things fixed .
i definitely recommend this location .
only reason i gave a star was yelp forced me too
so basically their guarantee is that there is no guarantee .
the crust is awesome .
it 's the perfect place for a weekend breakfast .
i bought some _num_ % and it 's really good fresh local milk .
i just had the worst experience ever .
what a disappointment .
will continue to order from them often .
staff is friendly and we 've never had a service problem .
the waitress was super nice .
the equipment is outdated .
amazing !
salad , zucchini , the ranch dressing , its all amazing .
it 's a fun place with old arcade games and lots of seating .
still highly recommend .
i would totally recommend this location and i will be returning !
such a great place !
amazing pastries !
too bad .
we both had the shrimp trio and we got a cheesecake to go .
what a great pet i got .
always has a far price .
so he offered to replace the _num_ piece white with _num_ dark meat choices .
i was disappointed to see the prior yelp page removed - why ?
the staff is friendly and helpful and the deals are great .
they are prompt , efficient and do excellent work .
nice selection .
it was great .
it was n't horrible tasting food , just bland for what i prefer .
alex our waiter , did an exceptional job .
it sure was quick , but , come on !
merchandise is really outdated .
the take-out is definitely worth it !
i am very happy with the deals i received .
i give them a _num_ because the food is delicious !
the gal there was very friendly , i had a lovely moscato sangria .
only reason i gave them _num_ star is because i had to .
i was told the wait time would be _num_ minutes .
the customer service is usually awful and the cashier lines are rarely ever open .
my tow assistance is set by progressive at 10am .
idiots !
drug deals out in the parking lot .
yelp failed us on this one .
they are very nice and easy to deal with .
she is also an canadian / bosnian .
if you want a great breakfast in a comfy place .
bonus !
it was _num_ degrees today .
rude hostess and bad customer service .
do n't plan on finding quality product at low prices .
our waitress kyle was very attentive , courteous and polite .
i paired the meal with earl soup and an iced tea !
no one should wait for what i had to wait for .
the food was amazing .
wow !
high quality `` homemade '' food .
i hardly doubt they reached their limit on a tuesday but who knows .
each serving could easily feed two .
no one has chow mien as good as may garden 's !
please beware they are looking for a buck at your expense !
their pizza is excellent but it is the wings that keep me coming back !
i left my purchases there along with another customer .
everything was horrible .
horrible !
great ambiance !
was a great help and excellent tow truck driver .
they would n't remove it from our bill nor offer any discounts .
not like they 're doing the work for free !
over cooked and disgusting .
i wanted to give you zero stars but it would n't let me .
here , this dish is bland , tasteless and has little to no seasonings .
highly recommend this shop .
very good ... .
if you have n't been here or are thinking of checking it.
excellent traditional eastern european food .
i 'll never b going back .
the pizza came more quickly than we had anticipated !
very disappointing food and waste of my time .
they get new inventory everyday , so it definitely worth checking out .
in addition to being wrong , the food was absolutely disgusting .
the food was also good .
this is easily the worst motel _num_ i have ever stayed in .
oh yeah !
they have some good carne asada and amazing rolled tacos .
horrible .
delicious subs i will be back again and again .
the grooming salon is fantastic .
very disappointed never going back to this ghetto restaurant is horrible !
apparently , i was not the only one with the roach issue .
it was very informative and also very personable .
i 'm glad i have a place to eat some good breakfast burritos !
this place is consistently bad .
one of our family favorites .
in sum , a very bad experience .
i love the meats and cheeses and the atmosphere .
do not eat here .
i cancelled my membership after a week .
do not use this company .
very reasonable prices , especially for what you get !
i seriously feel so gross right now after eating there tonight .
i really do n't miss this place nor will i ever crave anything here .
while the pizza was decent , the wings were awesome .
stop by for a beer sat .
so sad .
the restroom had no toilet paper or hand soap .
this has got to be the best place in arizona .
so i will say yay i am a fan !
actually , this location ( campus for compassion ) is truly magnificent .
my family loves this place !
the popcorn sucks .
there are only like _num_ chairs inside .
she takes her time and she is very nice .
wings and beer compliment the experience .
maybe she was confused to what i meant ?
service is friendly !
i 'd recommend this place for sure .
horrible system with seating .
not to mention the place was filthy !
lowest prices and friendly staff .
the front office staff has a friendly and helpful attitude .
got ripped off big time .
deli also has a good variety of meats .
food made to order , fresh ingredients , friendly staff and fair prices !
i am sad to see how much this place has gone downhill .
the inside was clean and well lit .
at the end you 'll be surprised & satisfied with the pricing .
the steak special and chicken parmesan are our favorites .
friendly staff .
good portion of food and food is hot .
my boyfriend got orange chicken and teriyaki chicken so we could share everything .
drove away , got on freeway headed out of town .
from outside this place looks sketchy at best .
i took my _num_ yr old dog into her first teeth cleaning last week .
not advertised as a special , just a normal item .
otherwise very please with the food ad service .
just a terrible location .
i was a little disappointed with the quality and portion .
it 's a beautiful location with a real focus on animals of all kinds .
we could n't wait till he was gone .
wonderful experience .
it took us about _num_ min to get the foods on the table .
the gentleman who replaced our tires was efficiently fast and paid attention to detail .
my family of _num_ will not be returning .
i was ate wings but i taste weird .
do n't eat the pizza , or hang out .
they are friendly and have wonderful attitudes .
it was good .
so done trying new nail places .
it 's definitely one of the best around the area !
beautiful cut and incredible color !
p e r i o d .
after _num_ minutes , the call was dropped .
this is a beautiful course that is tucked back in the foothills of ahwatukee .
abandoned motel next door with its windows busted out .
it 's just too weird .
i strongly suggest something ( anything ) else .
so disappointed !
-- with said gross !
there was no one else in there .
definately a place you can bring the family or just go for happy hour !
this is a great place .
it 's not hard to find , i swear .
but i have to get this off my chest .
i will be going back soon !
not a fan .
went through drive thru , ordered two _num_ piece chicken strips .
but it reminds me off chinese food prepared for a mexican clientele .
it was pretty odd for an almost empty restaurant .
but the best part of this visit were the tortas themselves .
that 's not my problem !
do n't eat here .
from the outside it looks suspect , but its nice inside .
thank you for doing an incredible job !
this is my favorite pizza and wing place ever .
was in the area and thought i would stop in for a burger .
friendly staff and big selection of almost anything you want .
i really did n't care .
if i could give this a negative star , i would .
i asked why he was being so rude .
the worst experience i have ever had at an enterprise location .
went to sam 's club last sunday with my mom .
went for an hour , will definitely come back for more fun !
all are delicious !
to start off i wish i could give them zero stars .
horrible wont ever go back .
for that reason , i 'll likely stay away from this establishment .
avoid this location .
unorganized and lack of integrity .
then he had to leave and try and get my refund processed .
the deli is great , good fresh bread & meat .
i got what i wanted for a good price .
not a family friendly place at all .
staff is very nice and helpful .
not impressed .
the food was amazing , everything homemade and fresh .
awesome authentic food !
take out is great and i would recommend getting take out there .
now this place sucks .
love this place for breakfast .
i ordered the bosnian sausage and was good .
worst place to live in az .
i 've gone with my mother to buy appliances here .
the desserts were delicious as well .
anyway , i saw _num_ shirt that was semi cute .
the buildings are semi quiet , ca n't complain about that .
amazing ribs and the fried pickles are delicious !
great food .
francisco was a great help .
i noticed a reply on my rating .
delicious sandwiches !
it was n't my idea to come .
fast , healthy , consistent , quality !
it was the most rudest most disrespectful thing he could have done .
my husband and i love this place !
too much bread ( $ ) for not enough meat ( meat ) .
nothing to report there .
if you have n't been here i definitely recommend it !
cool atmosphere .
like they do n't give a crap .
still great and will eat here again .
everything was fantastic , especially the bread !
we walk up and wait a bit in line , no big deal .
when the food finally arrived , it was n't anything spectacular .
usually , i could use my groupon right away but whatever '' .
very clean place too !
i have always found the staff very helpful .
the problem is the management & the maintenance staff do not fix anything .
the food is good with very generous portions of everything ... ... ... .
will not be eating little caesars ever again .
i ca n't even imagine what the kitchen looks like .
pastor joe has such a huge heart for his church members and community .
loved it here !
just uncomfortable .
nor will anyone else i know .
i then asked how long it would take was quoted _num_ hours .
excellent customer service !
dr. ho is absolutely amazing !
i was disappointed .
and the exterior is just as bad .
they also have great customer service .
great place to watch sports .
several others walked in behind me also with complaints on orders .
but seriously the employees here were excellent .
i will be recommending to every one i know .
service is so so .
great prices .
been here for years but they can never get it right .
yeah !
terrible service .
this location deserves zero stars !
i love the pizza and the wings !
i 'm impressed with this store !
the manager was yelling at the cashier while we placed our order .
really friendly staff too !
chicken was hot and yummy .
pleasant staff and decent atmosphere .
very kind and courteous staff and it is very clean .
frankly , i know better than to order wings from a national chain store .
and service is friendly and quick !
she was yelling so loud that the entire restaurant went quiet .
now , the one advantage i thought was present , is not .
would leave _num_ stars if i could .
the repair was made and the fridge stopped working the same night .
is n't this dinner time ?
wo n't go back to this waffle house again .
the worst customer service ever !
they go out of their way to assure that they are providing good service .
the staff was very professional and informative .
i asked if she could void the transaction and again i got a no .
soooo good .
i would definitely go back and would recommend everyone to try it !
i could n't even bring myself to finish one bowl .
she said , sorry you 're next .
i say again , do n't ever ever ever ever stay at this hotel !
majority of produce is fresh i loved the fresh okra .
the selection is just so-so .

this restaurant was very disappointing .
simple great flavor sand best bang for your buck .
this place is run down for a safeway .

these apartments are quiet and well kept .
first off we were treated rudely over the drive thru order radio .
the drive thru is supper dirty and the ppl there are rude !
there were a handful of flies waiting to greet us in our room .
the best has to be the bosnian sausages .

i would give zero stars if possible .
refuse to be treated poorly .
the egg was overcooked .
that should have been my first clue .

the rest was pretty good considering time of year .
very nice and very good at what they do !
omg i 'm hooked .
the food is always fresh and tasty .
authentic dishes .
wow this place is bad .
the best mexican restaurant .
the staff is super friendly , and eager to serve !
that 's pretty ridiculous .
not anymore .
very rudely he asked if he should do my fix before everyone else 's .
anyway , the service lacked in every way .
another purse had been put into the dust cover in its place .
there was comes a time when you make bad choices .
i will not adopt from them any longer either .
small menu , but the food is excellent .
i found it here with the _num_ '' super sub !
the bad : where do i begin ?
she then did not follow the comment up with a reason !
george is probably the only trustworthy employee in this whole entire complex .
she just is n't thorough .
love trying local places so we stopped in .
it is quiet and great to take friends .
great little chinese food place in our neighborhood with decent prices .
the food just did n't taste fresh .
we 'll not go back .
i love the bar .

they all have good quality food that makes for a good dinner .
haha could give another star for convenience but parking is bad !
the buns are really good , high quality .
she did n't greet me politely or acknowledge that i was there .
ahh , this place is refreshing .
chicken was best described as canned chicken .
this is amazing '' .
friendly service , delicious entrees = heaven !
dinner was great as usual .
i 've been coming here for years , good service , good food .
when we received our order it was missing country gravy on both our hashbrowns .
horrible service !
the store is clean & organized very well .
no way i could make it across town on a friday night .
this has to be the worst pizza hut location i have been to .
this place gave me the best head of my life .
the waitress kept checking on me ensuring everything was good .

they have great customer service , and are great to call in an order .
the store is very busy from 8am to about 10pm at night .
it 's now to the point where it 's disgusting .
buying here was the mistake of the year .
failure one was not checking the address or even bothering to take one .
first bite was great , then my wife commented that it was bleeding .
their food was delicious .
our main course came out before the soup !
the customer service and the food has always stayed consistent .
everytime i come to this particular subway i remember why i avoid this one .
great family owned restaurant and great food at decent prices .
it 's ghetto and the service is incredibly horrible .
i drive back there and wait in line to return my food .
appetizers , salads , buffalo wings and beers have also always been good .
it was great .
this is the third time in a row , we will not be returning !
will keep returning .
very happy with the service and product .
_num_ .
